**My personal [NUR](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR) repository**

## Packages

**palera1n**: Jailbreak for A8 through A11, T2 devices, on iOS/iPadOS/tvOS 15.0, bridgeOS 5.0 and higher. (Note: this package relies on resources hosted by palera1n and minor changes could cause hash mismatches if that occurs a manual hash fix should do the trick.)

**checkra1n-all-binaries**: Prebuilt binaries of the checkra1n jailbreak tool, covering macOS and multiple Linux architectures. This package installs all the architecture-specific binaries and mainly acts as a dependency for **palera1n**, which requires all binaries to be available for the build to succeed.
