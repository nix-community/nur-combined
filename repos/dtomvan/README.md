### Most notable packages
- Some firefox addons that were built from source
- Most [Tsoding](https://github.com/tsoding) software
- [Afio font](https://github.com/awnion/custom-iosevka-nerd-font)
- My own (very bad) `rwds-cli`, program to learn words with, also already available in [flake](https://github.com/dtomvan/rusty-words)
