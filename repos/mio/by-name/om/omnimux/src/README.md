# src

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Learn Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/learn-flutter)
- [Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Flutter learning resources](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/learning-resources)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Using Rust Inside Flutter

This project leverages Flutter for GUI and Rust for the backend logic,
utilizing the capabilities of the
[Rinf](https://pub.dev/packages/rinf) framework.

To run and build this app, you need to have
[Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
and [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
installed on your system.
You can check that your system is ready with the commands below.
Note that all the Flutter subcomponents should be installed.

```shell
rustc --version
flutter doctor
```

You also need to have the CLI tool for Rinf ready.

```shell
cargo install rinf_cli
```

Signals sent between Dart and Rust are implemented using signal attributes.
If you've modified the signal structs, run the following command
to generate the corresponding Dart classes:

```shell
rinf gen
```

Now you can run and build this app just like any other Flutter projects.

```shell
flutter run
```

For detailed instructions on writing Rust and Flutter together,
please refer to Rinf's [documentation](https://rinf.cunarist.org).
