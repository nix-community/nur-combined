      Remote SimGrid allows to study real distributed applications by sandboxing their execution in a SimGrid simulation.
      This is done by managing a simulated world in a dedicated process (rsg_server), and by providing an API so that the distributed application processes connect to rsg_server.
      The provided API calls are blocking, which allows rsg_server to control how the processes should execute in accordance with its simulation.
