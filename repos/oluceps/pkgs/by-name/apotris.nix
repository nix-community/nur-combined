      Apotris is a multiplatform open-source block stacking game! What sets
      Apotris apart from other block stacking games is its extensive
      customization options, complemented by ultra-responsive controls that let
      you execute your moves with precision. With 14 unique game modes and a
      plethora of settings, you can tailor the game to your preferences,
      ensuring a fresh and challenging experience every time you play. Whether
      you're a casual player or a hardcore enthusiast, Apotris has something for
      everyone. You can even battle your friends using the Gameboy Advance Link
      Cable or Wireless Adapters in 2-Player Battle! While Apotris was
      originally designed for Gameboy Advance, it now supports all kinds of
      platforms, so between the ports and emulation you can play Apotris on
      almost anything.
