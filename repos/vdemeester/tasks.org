- Should we use home-manager as a nixos module when the host is NixOS ?
- Experiment with that on a clean setup (VM, …)
- If we pin channels, I feel it make sense :)

As we are going to pin channel and use our =NIX_PATH= (based on =niv= files ; and later
most likely *flake*), we can safely assume we should be able to manage home-manager
through the nixos module. If I can use =nixos-rebuild …= as a user, it's even better.

That's a real interesting question.
The next question is then, what do we do with the existing setup ?
- link =./tmp/emacs= in =~/.emacs.d/= ?
- have a tool to help migrate (aka backup + link and later do something else) ?

So latest status on this.
- =/etc/home= with user rights might make the most sense. Why ?
  + At install time, I don't have a user yet
  + In all system, I can, in some way,

How does this work with =~/src/www= ? The main problem might be the =git clone= but I
think it's ok to use sudo for this.

The real question is :
- =/etc/home= everywhere ? or…
- =~/src/home= on fedora/ubuntu and =/etc/nixos= on nixos

It could also be in =/etc/nixos= if it is writable for the user (=vincent= in most case)

Final word on this:
- on =NixOS=, cloned in =/etc/nixos= linked to =~/src/home= (or the opposite), with =1000=
  rights (this can be ensured in the bootstrap/install script).
- on =Fedora=, cloned in =~/src/home= :)

Instead of relying on =nix-channel=, this should pin the version of all channel required
(nixos, nixos-unstable, nixpkgs, nixpkgs-unstable, home-manager, nur, …).

- This would allow more reproducibility on all the machines.
- This would also allow to create a bot to automatically update those channels…
  + … and run smoke tests using qemu for the configuration (automatically too)
- This would allow to cache pkgs more efficiently…
  + … as the ci could build against multiple /channels/
  + … as the machines would have the exact same /channels/ as the ci
- This would allow to run =nixos-rebuild switch= as a user without the mess of channels

Let's define a plan to experiment and work this out iteratively.

- Pin different channels in the configuration (?)
- Run the configuration against multiple channels (?)
- Use =nix.path= or à-la-tazjin or [[https://github.com/nmattia/niv][=niv=]] (which is close to tazjin's approach)

Some "good" examples

- [[https://github.com/lovesegfault/nix-config][https://github.com/lovesegfault/nix-config]]
- [[https://github.com/utdemir/dotfiles]]
- [[https://github.com/davidtwco/veritas]]

Those commands would work

#+begin_src nix
nix.nixPath = [ "nixpkgs=${sources.nixos}" ];
#+end_src

#+begin_src bash
nixos-rebuild dry-build -I nixpkgs=$(nix eval --raw '(import nix/sources.nix).nixos.outPath') -I nixos-config=/etc/nixos/configuration.nix
#+end_src

One trick to using =home-manager= as NixOS module makes it a bit tricky to use a different
package set. The question (to be answered at some point) is wether to use nixos-20.03 or
nixos-unstable. =nixos-20.03= with being able to use =unstable= package seems to be the
safest bet.

The main requirement is that /while experimenting/, it should not affect the rest of the
machines. [[https://github.com/lovesegfault/nix-config][lovesegfault/dotfiles]] is a good idea to follow as I can keep the current
behavior for most machines and experiment separately on another one. I shouldn't even need
to branch out.

The goal is:
- using niv =nix/= to update different sources
- being able to do =nix-build -A hokkaido= to build hokkaido from anywhere
  + having a =switch= script to run this locally (so that we can automate this in a timer)
- being able to use different sources for different machines (nixpkgs, nixos-20.03, …)
- sharing (still) a lot of the code (modules, pkgs, …)
- having a CI that build and cache to cachix.org
  + ideal world, auto-generate the ci configuration
- Use as much as =nix= as possible (most likely use scripts and nix)
- Still support using =home-manager= alone

Open questions:
- How to manage secrets ? for bootstrap && on change. This is especially important in the
  context of CI, if CI has to be able to build a configuration.

Let's use =hokkaido= for this (thinkpad x220s). Long term, =hokkaido= might be the
nixos-unstable machine and the rest more stable (servers, …). Also let's make sure we
document this all the way (litterate configuration).

Using a ~make~. Should it be submodules *or* subtree ?
- submodule makes the repo smaller
- subtree makes the repo reproductible

Submodule is easy to manage, especially in magit too

- Detect the host system
  + NixOS livecd/install (~nixos-configuration~)
  + NixOS installed, run as user (~home-manager~)
  + Fedora (~nixpkgs~ to install, ansible, …)

The main problem I can see still is : how do I bootstrap NixOS and how do I keep it
up-to-date.

- Should it link itself to the home at some point ?
- Should it be read-only (~/etc/nixos~) and only get updates from the main repository ?
  + This is 95% possible if I have good reproducibility, easily test my /shit/ using a VM
    or something (and quickly too)
