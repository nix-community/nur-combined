# What is `home`

`home` is the declarative configuration of my servers, desktops and laptops. This project is based
on the NixOS operating system and uses home-manager to manage my dotfiles, for both NixOS and
non-NixOS hosts (like WSL).

This repository is the monorepo for my personal tools and the declarative configuration of
my servers, desktops and laptops. It is based on the NixOS operating system and
`home-manager` (and some scripts) to manage my dotfiles, for both NixOS and non-NixOS
hosts (like Fedora, â€¦).

It is fully reproducible (utilizing [niv](https://github.com/nmattia/niv)) and position-independent, meaning there is no
moving around of `configuration.nix`. For the configurations' entry points see the
individual [systems](systems), as well as [default.nix](default.nix).

This will be a all-time work-in-progress, so please beware that things might change
dramatically or even not working anymore ðŸ˜›.

# TODO Installation

*todo: rework that part, link to the `docs` folder*

# Organization of the repository

*todo: rework that part*

This is probably gonna be a moving target, but this is how it looks (or should look
soon-ish ðŸ‘¼):

-   `docs`: holds documentation about this code, literate configuration, see [literate configuration](#orgbc889c3).
    `make publish` will publish the `README.org` and the `docs` folder to my website.
-   `lib`: shared code used during configuration (mostly `nix` code).
-   `machines`: configuration per machines
-   `modules`: holds nix modules (services, programs, hardware, profiles, â€¦)
-   `overlays`: holds [nix overlays](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Overlays)
-   `pkgs`: holds nix packages (those should migrate under `overlays` or on `nur-packages`)
-   `secrets`: holds non-shareable code, this folder is ignored and `make` commands will try
    to populate this. If it's empty, the rest of configuration is still meant to work but
    will contain empty secrets (or random ones).
-   `tmp`: things toâ€¦ organize (e.g. where I import my other *legacy* configuration)

<a id="orgbc889c3"></a>As I'm slowly, but <span class="underline">surely</span>, going to have `org-mode` files for
literate configuration files in this repository, I have to think of how to organize files
in order to end up with one huge file. The goal of having those `org-mode` files, is
mainly to document my configuration and publish it, most likely on [sbr.pm](https://sbr.pm).
