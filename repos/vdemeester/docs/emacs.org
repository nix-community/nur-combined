** What is this
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:6cf02bfd-0266-456f-be5f-728c75e3013e
:END:

The present document, referred to in the source code version as =emacs.org=, contains the
bulk of my configurations for GNU Emacs. It is designed using principles of "literate
programming": a combination of ordinary language and inline code blocks. Emacs knows how
to parse this file properly so as to evaluate only the elisp ("Emacs Lisp") included
herein. The rest is for humans to make sense of my additions and their underlying
rationale.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Literate programming allows us to be more expressive and deliberate. Not only we can use
typography to its maximum potential, but can also employ techniques such as internal links
between sections. This makes the end product much better for end users, than a terse
script.
#+END_QUOTE

I switched back and forth on using =org-mode= and literate programming, so why re-using
it. First, I think I went for it the wrong way the first time. I copied part of the
configuration from elsewhere, sometimes without really needing what I was copying. for
some reason I think this is a common pattern when configuring Emacs. You start by using a
distribution (Doom Emacs, Spacemacs, …) or by copying configuration from all over the
place. Slowly but surely you realize this was a mistake as you didn't learn anything, so
you *reboot* your configuration.

I'm taking [[https://protesilaos.com/][Protesilaos Stavrou]] approach on writing and configuring this file (see [[https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs/][his
dotemacs]]), although I am not loading it directly. I prefer using the [[https://orgmode.org/manual/tangle.html][tangle]] feature of
=org-mode= instead of loading it using ~org-babel~ function. This allows me to document my
configuration and generating final(s) ~.el~ files. Those files can then load and/or
pre-compile, without the need to load =org= first. It also means that I can add code
pieces in there that won't be /tangle/, like usage example ; and I also can use this to
generate any additional file I need, whatever the programming language they are written
in. [[https://protesilaos.com/][Protesilaos Stavrou]] is not my only source, here are some others:

** Why using GNU/Emacs ?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:165fca5a-b87d-4140-963b-658a2438e769
:END:

This is a question I thought I needed to answer, or at least, document why I am choosing
GNU/Emacs as my primary editor. [[https://protesilaos.com/][Protesilaos Stavrou]] has a [[https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2019-12-20-vlog-switch-emacs/][video]] about it, really
interesting.

There is a lot of reasons but for me, the following are the main ones:
- *Open Source*: this is a "of course", but my editor _has to be_ open-sourced. This seems
  to be the norm these days anyway (and for a long time, with =vim=).
- *Lightweight*: the editor should be relatively lightweight. I don't want a full browser
  loaded to edit files, and I want to be able to run it in a terminal, on a server. =vim=
  can do that (and sometimes, =vim= or =vi= is enough 👼).
- *Extensible*: to be honest, this is the most important reason. I want to be able to
  extend my editor as much as possible.

GNU/Emacs checks all the boxes for me. Even though GNU/Emacs is probably not as
lightweight as =vim=, it is definitely lightweight compared to all the Electron-based
editors (vscode, …). It is of course open-source, and since ages (almost as old as I am
😅). And best of all, GNU/Emacs is extensible as you couldn't dream of. Emacs is a lisp
interpreter, and it is designed to be extended in order to meet the user's
needs. /Extensibility/ is the quintessential Emacs quality. You can modify any piece of
elisp /in real time/.

I'm also a huge fan of /text-based/ software, a.k.a. do whatever you can using text :
reading mails, news, organizing notes and todos, all can be done in text. And GNU/Emacs
shines at this. For emails and news, you've got Gnus built-in, for notes and todos, the
wonderful =org-mode= is the best thing on earth (seriously, this is the *one* mode that
made me switch from =vim=).

** Assumptions
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:657c38cd-d910-42c2-bd8c-8c20171a8bd5
:END:

I'll make a few assumption in the following document (that may or may not be true):

- [[https://nixos.org/nix/][~nix~]] is available, either from [[https://nixos.org][NixOS]] or via an install of nix. I'll try my best to
  support non-nix environment, but it's definitely not my current focus.
  + As I am making the assumption that ~nix~ is available, I am also making the assumption
    that all the library required are already present (in my [[https://github.com/vdemeester/home][~home~]], there is a file
    called [[https://github.com/vdemeester/home/blob/master/modules/profiles/emacs.nix][~emacs.nix~]] that encapsulate those dependencies). This is why, by default
    *use-package* doesn't use the =ensure= option in 99% of the configuration.
- Any function I wrote is going to be prefixed by ~vde/~ so that it doesn't conflicts with
  function that would have been defined elsewhere.

*** TODO Keybinding

As it is detailed in each part of this configuration, I am trying to setup keybinding in a
/mnemonics/ way so it's easy to remember (and use). This is what [[https://www.spacemacs.org/][spacemacs]] does with evil
keybindings (aka vim-like keybindings). I am staying with the /standard/ emacs keybinding
as much as possible (as there is already some mnemonics in there).

There are countless jokes and comics on Emacs’s seemingly ridiculous keybindings. Good
laughs indeed, but at the end of day, it’s not incomprehensible. It has well-defined
conventions listed at [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html%5Fnode/elisp/Key-Binding-Conventions.html][Emacs Key Bindings Convention]]. In summary, the general rules are:

+ =C-x= reserved for Emacs native essential keybindings: buffer, window, frame, file, directory, etc…
+ =C-c= reserved for user and major mode:
  - =C-c letter= reserved for user. =<F5>=-=<F9>= reserved for user.
  - =C-c C-letter= reserved for major mode.
+ Don’t rebind =C-g=, =C-h= and =ESC=.

To give a small example, most of my personal =org-mode= keybinding will start with =C-c
o=, as it is reserved for user, and =o= is for =org-mode=. For version control, it's gonna
be =C-c v=, for projects it's gonna be =C-c p=, etc…

:END:

This section contains configurations that are needed prior to the setup of everything
else. Anything that needs to be configured first should be in there, this includes the
~init.el~ and ~early-init.el~ files content.

** Initiazing emacs
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:4886d661-e2e0-4a75-bf3f-e85aef27b50c
:END:

Starting with Emacs 27, an =early-init.el= file can be used to do early configuration
and optimization.

#+begin_quote
Emacs can now be configured using an early init file. The file is called ~early-init.el~,
in ~user-emacs-directory~. It is loaded very early in the startup process: before
graphical elements such as the tool bar are initialized, and before the package manager is
initialized. The primary purpose is to allow customizing how the package system is
initialized given that initialization now happens before loading the regular init file
(see below).

We recommend against putting any customizations in this file that don't need to be set up
before initializing installed add-on packages, because the early init file is read too
early into the startup process, and some important parts of the Emacs session, such as
'window-system' and other GUI features, are not yet set up, which could make some
customization fail to work.
#+end_quote

We can use this to our advantage and optimize the initial loading of emacs.

- Before Emacs 27, the init file was responsible for initializing the package manager by
  calling `package-initialize'.  Emacs 27 changed the default behavior: It now calls
  `package-initialize' before loading the init file.

  #+INCLUDE: "../tools/emacs/early-init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "PkgStartup" :range-end "-PkgStartup" :lines "3-4"

- Let's inhibit resizing the frame at early stage.

  #+INCLUDE: "../tools/emacs/early-init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "FrameResize" :range-end "-FrameResize" :lines "7-8"

- I never use the /menu-bar/, or the /tool-bar/ or even the /scroll-bar/, so we can safely
  disable those very very early.

  #+INCLUDE: "../tools/emacs/early-init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "DisableUI" :range-end "-DisableUI" :lines "11-15"

- Finally we can try to avoid garbage collection at startup. The garbage collector can
  easily double startup time, so we suppress it at startup by turning up ~gc-cons-threshold~
  (and perhaps ~gc-cons-percentage~) temporarily.

  #+INCLUDE: "../tools/emacs/early-init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "GarbageCollection" :range-end "-GarbageCollection" :lines "18-20"

- Another small optimization concerns on =file-name-handler-alist= : on every .el and .elc
  file loaded during start up, it has to runs those regexps against the filename ; setting
  it to ~nil~ and after initialization finished put the value back make the initialization
  process quicker.

  #+INCLUDE: "../tools/emacs/early-init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "FileNameHandler" :range-end "-FileNameHandler" :lines "23-25"

  However, it is important to reset it eventually. Not doing so will cause garbage
  collection freezes during long-term interactive use. Conversely, a ~gc-cons-threshold~
  that is too small will cause stuttering.

  #+INCLUDE: "../tools/emacs/early-init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "AfterInitHook" :range-end "-AfterInitHook" :lines "61-67"

One thing though, I am currently not necessarily running Emacs 27, so I am going to need
to have the same configuration in ~init.el~ for a little bit of time.

/Note: the lowest emacs version I wanna support is 26 (as of today, might evolve)/

#+INCLUDE: "../tools/emacs/init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "CheckVer" :range-end "-CheckVer" :lines "25-35"

We also want our configuration to be working the same on any computer, this means we want
to define every option by ourselves, not relying on default files (~default.el~) that
would be set by our distribution. This is where =inhibit-default-init= comes into play,
setting it to non-nil inhibit loading the ~default~ library.

We also want to inhibit some initial default start messages and screen. The default screen
will be as bare as possible.

#+INCLUDE: "../tools/emacs/init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "Inhibit" :range-end "-Inhibit" :lines "38-42"

Let's also use =y= or =n= instead of =yes= and =no= when exiting Emacs.

#+INCLUDE: "../tools/emacs/init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "Confirm" :range-end "-Confirm" :lines "45-46"

One last piece to the puzzle is the default mode. Setting it to fundamental-mode means we
won't load any /heavy/ mode at startup (like =org-mode=). We also want this scratch buffer
to be empty, so let's set it as well

#+INCLUDE: "../tools/emacs/init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "DefaultMode" :range-end "-DefaultMode" :lines "49-51"

*** Unicode all the way
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:df45a01a-177d-4909-9ce7-a5423e0ea20f
:END:

By default, all my systems are configured and support =utf-8=, so let's just make it a
default in Emacs ; and handle special case on demand.

#+INCLUDE: "../tools/emacs/init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "Unicode" :range-end "-Unicode" :lines "54-59"

*** Package management with =use-package=
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:112262a1-dd4d-4a50-a9e2-85b36bbbd95b
:END:

=use-package= is a tool that streamlines the configuration of packages. It handles
everything from assigning key bindings, setting the value of customisation options,
writing hooks, declaring a package as a dependency for another, and so on.

#+begin_quote
The =use-package= macro allows you to isolate package configuration in your =.emacs= file
in a way that is both performance-oriented and, well, tidy.  I created it because I have
over 80 packages that I use in Emacs, and things were getting difficult to manage.  Yet
with this utility my total load time is around 2 seconds, with no loss of functionality!
#+end_quote

With =use-package= we can improve the start-up performance of Emacs in a few fairly simple
ways. Whenever a command is bound to a key it is configured to be loaded only once
invoked. Otherwise we can specify which functions should be autoloaded by means of the
=:commands= keyword.

We need to setup the emacs package system and install =use-package= if not present
already.

#+INCLUDE: "../tools/emacs/init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "UsePackageSetup" :range-end "-UsePackageSetup" :lines "62-111"

*** =custom.el=
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:1ddaf27e-ff7c-424e-8615-dd0bd22b685f
:END:

When you install a package or use the various customisation interfaces to tweak things to
your liking, Emacs will append a piece of elisp to your init file. I prefer to have that
stored in a separate file.

#+INCLUDE: "../tools/emacs/init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "CustomFile" :range-end "-CustomFile" :lines "116-131"

*** Remove built-in =org-mode=
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:9462c0d7-03be-4231-8f22-ce1a04be32b1
:END:

I want to make sure I am using the installed version of =orgmode= (from my org
configuration) instead of the built-in one. To do that safely, let's remove the built-in
version out of the load path.

#+INCLUDE: "../tools/emacs/init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "NoBuiltinOrg" :range-end "-NoBuiltinOrg" :lines "134-140"

*** Loading configuration files
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:d6aebc56-aadb-4b01-8404-bb922d12f8a8
:END:

This =org-mode= document /tangles/ into several files in different folders :
- ~config~ for my configuration
- ~lisp~ for imported code or library I've written and not yet published

I used to load them by hand in the ~init.el~ file, which is very cumbersome, so let's try
to automatically load them. I want to first load the file in the ~lisp~ folder as they are
potentially used by my configuration (in ~config~).

Let's define some functions that would do the job.

#+INCLUDE: "../tools/emacs/init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "LoadCfgFunc" :range-end "-LoadCfgFunc" :lines "143-153"

Let's define some constants early, based on the system, and the environment, to be able to
use those later on to skip some package or change some configuration accordingly.

#+INCLUDE: "../tools/emacs/init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "CfgConstant" :range-end "-CfgConstant" :lines "156-187"

Now, in order to load ~lisp~ and ~config~ files, it's just a matter of calling this
function with the right argument.

#+INCLUDE: "../tools/emacs/init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "CfgLoad" :range-end "-CfgLoad" :lines "190-195"

Finally, I want to be able to load files for a specific machine, in case I need it (not
entirely sure why yet but…)

#+INCLUDE: "../tools/emacs/init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "CfgHostLoad" :range-end "-CfgHostLoad" :lines "198-200"

To make sure my emacs instance and my user environment setup is always /similar/, I use
=exec-path-from-shell=.

#+begin_quote
Ever find that a command works in your shell, but not in Emacs?

This happens a lot on OS X, where an Emacs instance started from the GUI inherits a
default set of environment variables.

This library solves this problem by copying important environment variables from the
user's shell: it works by asking your shell to print out the variables of interest, then
copying them into the Emacs environment.

:END:

I want to keep the =~/.emacs.d= folder as clean as possible. The [[https://github.com/emacscollective/no-littering][no-littering]] project
helps wit that.

#+begin_quote
The default paths used to store configuration files and persistent data are not consistent
across Emacs packages. This isn't just a problem with third-party packages but even with
built-in packages.

Some packages put these files directly in user-emacs-directory or $HOME or in a
subdirectory of either of the two or elsewhere. Furthermore sometimes file names are used
that don't provide any insight into what package might have created them.

This package sets out to fix this by changing the values of path variables to put
configuration files in no-littering-etc-directory (defaulting to ~/.emacs.d/etc/) and
persistent data files in no-littering-var-directory (defaulting to ~/.emacs.d/var/), and
by using descriptive file names and subdirectories when appropriate. This is similar to a
color-theme; a "path-theme" if you will.
#+end_quote

Let's configure it *and* make sure we load it as soon as possible (hence the
=config/00-clean.el=).

As I am loading =recentf= during this cleanup part, I need to setup recentf before 😅. In
a gist:

- I keep about 200 items.
- I don't want the /auto-cleanup/ of recentf items to happen when the mode is loaded (a.k.a.
  at startup). It is configured to run after 360s of idle time.
- I don't really want to show the Nth number of the items.
- I don't want recentf to save remote, =su= and =sudo= items (=ssh:=, =sudo:=, …)

** TODO Completion framework and extras
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:f352f694-f22c-4e19-b1ff-fdd8405ef8c0
:END:

One of the optimal way of using Emacs is through searching and narrowing selection
candidates. Spend less time worrying about where things are on the screen and more on how
fast you can bring them into focus. This is, of course, a matter of realigning priorities,
as we still wish to control every aspect of the interface.

Since the day I started using Emacs, I used multiple completion framework, from the
/built-in/ =ido-mode=, to =ivy= (and =counsel=) passing through =helm= at some point. I
never experimented with any sort of customisations to the generic minibuffer
experience. Nor did I ever bother with the oldest built-in tool of the sort (icomplete)
that is designed to complement the minibuffer's internal mechanisms for matching
items, until I've watched [[https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2020-02-26-emacs-icomplete/][Protesilaos video on it]].

It turns out that, despite appearances to the contrary, the defaults are very powerful,
opening up a range of possibilities to those eager to learn and experiment (a common theme
in Emacs).

In the following package declarations I am defining several functions that enhance the
experience of icomplete. These are part of a learning process to (i) explore the internals
of Emacs and study how various problems are solved with elisp, and (ii) determine how far
one can go, in terms of efficient functionality, without deviating from the norms inherent
to the tools that are shipped with Emacs.

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:5fb80d63-6c5b-4d2d-9755-ffe48c851b73
:END:

 The minibuffer is the locus of extended command interaction. Whether it is about offering
 input to a prompt, performing a search, executing a function by its name, the minibuffer
 remains at the epicentre. The default experience is far more powerful than it seems to
 be. It can get even better by tweaking the available customisation options and defining
 our own extensions.

I am an heavy user of [[https://orgmode.org/][=org-mode=]]. This is most likely *the one* mode that made me switch
back to GNU/Emacs years back.

#+begin_quote
Org mode is for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, planning projects, and authoring
documents with a fast and effective plain-text system.
#+end_quote

I'm going to quote [[https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs/#h:4e8347de-415e-4804-b383-d61499e05ca1][Protesilaos Stavrou]] too as he describe it way better than I would do.

#+begin_quote
 Org offers you the basic tools to organise your life in super-efficient ways using
 nothing but plain text.

In its purest form, Org is a markup language that is similar to Markdown: symbols are used
to denote the meaning of a construct in its context, such as what may represent a headline
element or a phrase that calls for emphasis.

What lends Org its super powers though is everything else built around it: a rich corpus
of elisp functions that automate, link, combine, enhance, structure, or otherwise enrich
the process of using this otherwise simple markup language. This very document is written
in org-mode while its website version is produced by a function that exports Org notation
into its HTML equivalent.
#+end_quote

I am using =org-mode= for managing my tasks and partly my daily agenda, for /journaling/,
knowledge database (taking notes on stuff) and publishing documents (right now mainly on
[[https://sbr.pm][sbr.pm]]). I have been using =org-mode= for a while now, I feel some of my configuration may
be heavily /tailored/ to my needs.

The /base/ user keybinding for =org-mode= (and related modes) is =C-c o= (e.g. showing
agenda is =C-c o a=, capture is =C-c o c=, …).

*** Base settings                                                  :ATTACH:

:END:

First, let's define some basic constants, mainly on how my main =org= folder is organized.

#+INCLUDE: "../tools/emacs/config/config-org.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "OrgConstants" :range-end "-OrgConstants" :lines "7-18"

In a nutshell, I am currently trying the following organization, with =~/desktop/org/= as
the base of almost all =org-mode= things:

+ =projects= is the main /TODO/ folder. It holds todos and current projects along with ideas.
  - =inbox.org= is my inbox, where most of my captured todo, ideas and link will be store,
    waiting for reviews.
  - =incubate.org= is where I store my ideas that could become projects at some point. It
    is also waiting for reviews (once a week more or less).
  - =next.org= is where simple todos are stored, quick one shot /things/ that do not need
    a project to be created.
  - ={project}.org= are files that holds a project information and todos. It can be
    /long-lived/ projects (like =redhat.org= or =tekton.org=) or, prefered, /short-lived/
    projects, like =rework-infra.org= or =tekton-beta.org=. Once a project is marked as
    done or completed, it either goes into the =archive=, or into =technical= ; if it can
    be published.
+ =technical= is the public / to-be-published documents and /public/ knowledge base. It can holds todos, but its main
  purpose is to be publish, at [[https://sbr.pm][sbr.pm]]. Thus, it's organization is the same as the
  website.
+ =personal= is my private knowledge base. Those are private information or notes that I
  don't want to publish *and* might be encrypted (using =gnupg=).
+ =archive= holds all archived files (projects, todos from =projects= files, …)

Additionnaly, I may have =org-mode= files and /todos/ in other files, like in my
=~/.emacs.d= folder or my [[https://github.com/vdemeester/home][=home=]] configuration.

I want a way to quickly jump to certain =org-mode= files, like =next.org= or the
=inbox.org=. For this, we can use the emacs [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Registers.html][registers]] and more accurately the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/File-Registers.html#File-Registers][file
registers]].

#+INCLUDE: "../tools/emacs/config/config-org.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "OrgRegisters" :range-end "-OrgRegisters" :lines "21-26"

With this, I can jump to the inbox with ~C-x r j i~, to the journal using ~C-x r j j~, …

Let's setup the base of =org-mode=, with the following things in mind:

- Agenda :: =org-agenda-files= contains =~/desktop/org/=, =~/.emacs.d/= and
  =~/.config/nixpkgs/=. The rest of the configuration will happen when configuring
  =org-agenda=.
- Navigation and key bindings ::
  + As said before, =C-c o= is the prefix of my user specific keybindings
    - =C-c o l= is to store the link (default keybinding is =C-c C-l=)
    - =C-c o r r= is to refile a task from an org-mode buffer (default keybinding is =C-c
      C-w=, and there is a different keybinding when in an org-mode agenda buffer)
  + Activating [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Speed-Keys.html][/speed commands/]], aka being able to use one keystroke to do some action (like
    changing the TODO state, …)
  + =C-a=, =C-e= and =C-k= should be =org-mode= aware. This is achieved by setting
    =org-special-ctrl-a/e= and =org-special-ctrl-k= to =t=.
- To-do settings :: My current setup of /todo-keywords/ (a.k.a. =org-todo-keywords=) might
  be more complicated that it should be but I've been using it a while
  now. =org-todo-keywords= is a list of sequences, I have three:
  + =TODO= → =NEXT= → =STARTED= → =DONE= /or/ =CANCELED=
  + =WAITING= → =SOMEDAY= → move to a =TODO= or =CANCELED=
  + =IDEA= → move to a =TODO= or =CANCELED=

  I am leaning towards simplifying this, especially as =NEXT= is not really useful (I have
  =next.org= for this), and =IDEA= or =WAITING= are not really used either (=IDEA= goes
  into =incubate.org= and I don't seem to use =WAITING=).

  /I need to update and document =org-todo-state-tags-triggers= too/
- Tags :: I am using generic tags and some groups. Groups allow to define mutually
  exclusive tags, like =#home= and =#work= (can't be both). This is achieve by using
  =:startgroup= and =:endgroup= in the =org-tag-alist= variable. It is also possible to
  define [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Tag-Hierarchy.html#Tag-Hierarchy][tag hierarchies]] but I didn't look into it yet.

  I also want to have tag inheritance, aka children entry inherits their parent's tag —
  even though it may have a cost (search, …), it allows to reduce lots of /duplications/.
- Refile :: In the =org-mode= jargon, this means moving an entry from one heading (parent
  entry) to another. This move can be done across files. =org-mode= displays a list of
  choice, this list is controlled by the =org-refile-targets= variable.

  The =org-refile-targets= is pretty powerful if you read the doc. You specify a list of
  file and some /search/ options for org to build its list from. Those options can be the
  level of the entry, some tag, regular expression, … In my case, I want this list to be
  all the =org= file in the =project= folder and also the =inbox.org= file. For the inbox,
  I want to look only at level 0 (aka root), for the other, I want to look at level 1 (aka
  root and sub entries).

  I also changed the default way to show the refile targets (=level1/level2/level3=) to
  include the file name. When refiling, you can either do the completion hierarchically
  (select the file, then the first level, …) or you can display all the choice at once. I
  tend to prefer having all the choice at once and let my completion framework (=ivy= as
  of now) to do the /fuzzy/ selection.

  Finally, I want to be able to create new node if I want, while refiling, so I'm setting
  =org-refile-allow-creating-parent-nodes= to =confirm=, to ask me if I am sure 👼.
- User Interface ::
  + I want, by default, to display the effort and clock summary on org columns, so I am
    setting the =org-columns-default-format= to do that.

    [[./images/2020-02-29-13-46-08.png]]

  + I want to /fontify/ the whole header line (it tends to look better for some theme)
  + I want things /pretty/, hence the =org-pretty-entities= 😹
  + When a entry (or a drawer) is closed, I like having a visual cue that it is. I chose
    the =…= character to show that. It can be set with =org-ellipsis=.
- Logging :: =org-mode= allows to write the time (or a note) on a entry state change, this
  is achieved by the =org-log-*= variables. On marking entries as =DONE= or when
  rescheduling them (or changing the deadline), I want to mark the time.

  Additionally, when I log those state changes, I don't want them to pollute the content
  of the to-do (aka description, …). Setting =org-log-int-drawer= will insert those logs
  in a =LOGBOOK= drawer (same as the property drawer).
- Archiving :: I don't want to pollute my current folder with =_archive= files, so I am
  redefining =org-archive-location= to archive to my =org-default-completed-dir=, also
  using =datetree= to put archived items in a datetree.
- Miscellaneous ::
  + I am setting up =org-use-property-inheritance= to make children node inherit their
    parent property. It has a cost on search but I feel, as for tag inheritance, it is
    worth the cost.
  + Still on properties, =org-global-properties= allows you to add values to properties
    that will show in the completion when setting those. For example, setting =EFFORT_ALL=
    to a list, will give you those options when you are trying to set the effort property.
  + I am setting =org-enforce-todo-dependencies= to make sure a parent entry cannot be
    mark as done if children are not in complete state (=DONE=, =CANCELLED=, …).
  + I want to add a new blank line whenever I create a new entry *but* I don't want that
    extra new blank line when adding a new list item. =org-blank-before-new-entry= allow
    to customize that behaviour.
  + I don't want to load inline image at startup ; it slows down for nothing.

/The =ensure org-plus-contrib= is there to make sure I am loading the =org= module from my
nix configuration and not the built-in =org= module (that might lag in terms of version)/

#+INCLUDE: "../tools/emacs/config/config-org.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "OrgMain" :range-end "-OrgMain" :lines "29-106"

I've set-up an =org-mode= hook to add few modes to the default setup.
- I am really annoyed by trailing white-space so I want them to be shown
- If the major mod is not =org-agenda-mode= (a sub-mode of =org-mode=)
  + I set the =fill-column= to ~90~ (instead of the usual ~80~), and I enable =auto-fill= mode.
  + I turn on =auto-revert-mode= so that the buffer is always up-to-date.
  + I like to have header indented, so I'm enabling =org-indent-mode=.

#+INCLUDE: "../tools/emacs/config/config-org.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "OrgHook" :range-end "-OrgHook" :lines "109-121"

Let's also use =org-id=…

#+INCLUDE: "../tools/emacs/config/config-org.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "OrgId" :range-end "-OrgId" :lines "124-153"

what I have to do that, what I can do. This is also where I log my work (see /Clocking/
below).

#+begin_quote
Due to the way Org works, TODO items, time-stamped items, and tagged headlines can be
scattered throughout a file or even a number of files.  To get an overview of open action
items, or of events that are important for a particular date, this information must be
collected, sorted and displayed in an organized way.
#+end_quote

Invoking =org-agenda= presents a list of possible options. There as a list of built-in
agenda views, where =a= shows all the items that have date assigned to them (=SCHEDULED=
or =DEADLINE=), =t= for listing to-dos, =T= for listing to-dos with a specific state and
=m= for more advanced matching possibilities.

I am using [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-super-agenda/][=org-super-agenda=]] to /supercharge/ the =org-mode= agenda 👼 to define my own
agenda views. This allows to group things and overall set-up the agenda view I want. This

The =org-capture= tool is a powerful way to quickly produce some kind of structured
information with little interruption of your workflow. With =org-agenda=, this is one of
the most used feature of =org-mode= (at least for me).

Each template is accessed via a key. These are listed in a buffer when you call
=org-capture=. Unique keys give direct access to their template, whereas templates that
share a common initial key will produce a second selection list with the remaining
options. This is very interesting when you want to group some capture template together
(like templates related to /work/, …).

Some of my capture template are big and hard to read if embedded in the =emacs-lisp=
code. The good thing is that =org-mode= is able to load the template from files too 💃.

Here is a list of my templates:

** TODO Email and newsgroup
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:afa562d5-b07e-413b-8c1d-2d489fb72900
:END:

I have been back and forth on using email inside Emacs, from ~mu4e~ to ~notmuch~. In the
past I have used Thunderbird, and for a while now, I have been only using webmail UI for
emails (and mobile apps of course). I recently re-discover [[https://www.gnus.org/][Gnus]] as a mail reader, so my
current setup is the following:

- [[https://www.gnus.org/][Gnus]], the Emacs built-in newsreader and email client.
- ~notmuch~ to be able to browse my mail backups (using ~isync~, …), see [[https://sbr.pm/technical/mail-setup.html][here]] for the
  current setup.

One of the main reason to rely on [[https://www.gnus.org/][Gnus]] instead of ~notmuch~ for the mails, is that I don't
need to worry about some complex mechanism for syncing, storing and indexing email. I
still use ~notmuch~ with ~isync~ to backup my mails somewhere, with the possibility to
search them.

Before configuring any email client, we need to establish some essentials: who we are,
where our credentials are stored and whether encryption is supported.

*** Gnus
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:0aeec7d8-b6c9-4244-8c10-2788c6e89cc5
:END:

The documentation describes Gnus as the /"coffee-brewing, all singing, all dancing,
kitchen sink newsreader"/. It is massive, which means the learning curve is more or less
similar to =org-mode=. You need to go slowly, starting simple and enhance your workflow
and configuration along the way.

Now some basic information on the abstractions that Gnus relies on:

1. The default Gnus buffer is called "Group".  It will present you with a list of all the
   news sources you have subscribed to.  By default, Gnus only displays messages that have
   not been read.  The same applies for groups.  The "Group" buffer will be empty the very
   first time you log in because you have not subscribed to anything yet.  Use =g= to
   fetch new messages from the sources.  If you only want to refresh the group at point,
   do it with =M-g=.
2. The "Server" buffer contains a list with all the sources you have specified for
   discovering news.  In my case, these are my email accounts and a Usenet server where
   mailing lists are hosted.  To access the "Server" buffer from inside the "Group"
   buffer, just hit the caret sign =^=.  To subscribe to an item, place the point over it
   and hit =u=.  Do that for your email's inbox and for whatever mailing lists you intend
   to follow.
3. The "Summary" buffer contains all the messages of a group.  Hitting the return key over
   a message will split the view in two, with the list above and the message below.  Use
   =n= or =p= to move to the next or previous unread message (or =N= and =P= to just the
   next/prev).  You access the "Summary" buffer both from the "Group" and the "Server" by
   entering a group.

As noted, Gnus will only show you a list of unread items. To view all your groups, hit
=L=. Use the lower case version =l= to view only the unread ones. To produce a Summary
buffer with read items, hit =C-u RET= over a group and specify the number of messages you
want to list (the other option is =C-u M-g= from inside the Summary). Another useful trick
for the Summary buffer is the use of the caret sign (=^=) to show you the previous message
that the current item is a reply to.

/Note: this is in a =gnus/init.el= file that is loaded when the =gnus= command is
ran. This means it is only loaded whenever I need to use =gnus= and not before/

Let's first configure the essentials of Gnus.

The =gnus-select-method= sets the default method for fetching news items. As I want to
read mail from several accounts in addition to following Usenet sources, I choose to set
it to nil.

The =gnus-secondary-select-methods= is where my accounts are specified. Each =nnimap= list
points to a specific line in my =authinfo.gpg= file. My emails all use the same server so
this method allows me to specify the username (email) and password combination for each of
them /without/ making this information public.  I am not sure whether the =nnimap-stream=
and =nnimap-authinfo-file= are needed, but I keep them for the sake of completeness.

:CUSTOM_ID: h:2beac436-62ba-4b52-acc5-559016ec477f
:END:

Gnus has something call the "agent", which represent the bridge between Gnus and the
server it connects to. Gnus is said to be "plugged" when a connection is established,
otherwise it is "unplugged".

Technicalities aside, we basically use this to save a local copy of the items we have
already fetched from the server.  We can also use the agent to configure the handling of
local messages.  For example, we can set an expiry date, after which the message is
deleted, or we can create a queue of outgoing messages when Gnus is in an unplugged state.

:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:c089372e-4aeb-4daf-96d5-77a997ff2dd0
:END:

By default, Gnus performs all its actions in a synchronous fashion. This means that Emacs
is blocked until Gnus has finished. By enabling this library, we can use certain functions
in a non-blocking way. I do this for [[#h:8cd8c972-ba38-40c2-b30f-68a4233593d6][sending email]].

**** Gnus group
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: h:4e52ab94-4e54-41df-a43e-db0c8d23a55a
:END:

Let's dig a bit more into groups :

+ A group can be assigned a level of importance.  This is a grade whose highest score is 1
  and the lowest is 6 (customisable though). Each level has a different colour. To assign
  a new value to the group at point, do it with =S l= and then give it a number.  Once you
  have graded your groups, you can perform various actions on a per-level basis.  For
  example, to refresh all levels from 1 up to 3 but not higher, pass a numeric argument to
  the standard =g= command. So =C-3 g= (this is the same as =C-u 3 g=).
+ Groups can be organised by topic. Create a new one with =T n= and give it a name.  Move
  a group to a topic with =T m=. To toggle the view of topics use =t= (I have a hook that
  does this automatically at startup). The level of indentation tells us whether a topic
  is a sub-set of another.  Use =TAB= or =C-u TAB= to adjust it accordingly. As with
  levels, you can operate on a per-topic basis. For example, to catch up on all the news
  of a given topic (mark all as read), you place the point over it, hit =c= and then
  confirm your choice.

Note that =gnus-group-sort-functions= requires the most important function to be declared
last.

**** Gnus Summary
:PROPERTIES:

:END:

Threads should not be hidden, while messages whose root has been removed should be grouped
together in some meaningful way. Furthermore, when moving up or down in the list of
messages using just =n= or =p=, I want to go to the next message, regardless of whether it
has been read or not.  I can otherwise rely on standard Emacs motions.

The formatting of the threads using Unicode characters was taken from the [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GnusFormatting][relevant Emacs
wiki entry]] plus some minor tweaks by me.

The =gnus-user-date-format-alist=, this basically adapts the date to whether the message
was within the day or the one before, else falls back to a default value. It is then
called with =%&user-date;=.

#+INCLUDE: "../tools/gnus/init.el" src emacs-lisp :range-begin "GnusSummary" :range-end "-GnusSummary" :lines "124-167"

Gnus summary displays a mark for each messages, those `O`, `!`, … Let's first describe
what are those marks (from the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/gnus/Marking-Articles.html#Marking-Articles][documentation]]) and which one make the more sense for me.
Most of those marks can be set using the =M= prefix (or =M M=) from the Summary buffer.

First there is two groups of /marks/ : *unread* and *read*. Note they do not entirely map
to what IMAP defines or what you would see in another mail UI (webmail, …).

+ *unread*: those will appear by default on a Summary buffer (almost 😜)
  - =<SPC>= are the /standard/ unread, never read. Once a mail is read you can mark it back as
    unread with =M M u u=.
  - =!= is for /ticked/. This is similar to the *starred* thread/message on GMail (or
    Thunderbird, … — in ~notmuch~ it appears as =flagged=). Those will always appear in
    the summary, so this is mainly for really important message to be remembered all the
    time.
  - =?= is for /dormant/. This is similar to /ticked/ *but* the article will only appear
    if there is a follow-up of the message. This would be a good use of "waiting for an
    answer so keep it".
+ *read*: those will not appear by default on a Summary buffer
  - =r= and =R= are /just read/ (like in the /reading session/) more or less
  - =O= is /read/ in an older session
  - =Y= is for /too low of a score/, this means this message got automatically read
    because it had low score (/more on that later/).
  - =E= is for /marked as expirable/, so that Gnus can delete/expunge them (or do
    something else — /more on that later/).
  - =M= is for /duplicated/.
  - =K=, =X= are for /killed/, =C= is for /catchup/ =Q= is for /sparsely reffed article/
    and =G= is for cancelled — not sure what this means yet…

We can use the built-in directory editor (file manager) as a more convenient way of
performing certain tasks that relate to emails, such as attaching all the marked items of

Run =C-h m= inside of a Dired buffer that has =gnus-dired-mode= enabled and search for
"gnus" to see all the relevant key bindings and the functions they call. I only ever use
=C-c C-m C-a= (=C-m= is the same as =RET=).

The value of mouse-wheel-scroll-amount means the following:

- By default scroll by one line.
- Hold down Shift to do so by five lines.
- Hold down Meta to scroll half a screen.
- Hold down Control to adjust the size of the text. This is added in Emacs 27.

By enabling mouse-drag-copy-region we automatically place the mouse selection to the kill
ring. This is the same behaviour as terminal emulators that place the selection to the
clipboard (or the primary selection).

The other options in short:

- Hide mouse pointer while typing.
- Enable mouse scroll.
- Faster wheel movement means faster scroll.

I navigate between themes, but the more I use Emacs (or any editor really), the more I
lean towards writing my own. Those theme are base on [[https://github.com/Jannis/emacs-constant-theme][=emacs-constant-theme=]] which is "A
calm, almost monochrome color theme for Emacs with a dark and light variant".

My main goal is to make a theme that, at least for syntax highlighting, differs from the
usual color(ful) themes. The reason come from a [[https://www.linusakesson.net/programming/syntaxhighlighting/][bunch]] [[https://jameshfisher.com/2014/05/11/your-syntax-highlighter-is-wrong/][of]] [[https://www.robertmelton.com/project/syntax-highlighting-off/][articles]] and [[https://asylum.madhouse-project.org/blog/2018/09/06/the-brutalist-path/][repositories]] that
discuss how, /maybe/ the way we see and use syntax highlighting today is not optimum. This
is a _touchy_ subject to see the least but it does make sense to me: I want to highlight
comments (because they may be important to understand the code), and I don't want to
highlight the language keyword more than the actual code.

I wrote two version, a dark one and a light one. I currently mainly use the light theme
(as this is when I do work 😅).
