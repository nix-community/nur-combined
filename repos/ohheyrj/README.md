This repository contains a curated collection of custom Nix packages for macOS (Darwin), built to fill gaps in the official [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) repository.

These packages were created because they are **not currently available in `nixpkgs`**, or are pending review in upstream pull requests. The long-term goal is to contribute each package **back to upstream** once they meet the necessary quality and packaging standards.

Packages are grouped by category, and each entry includes metadata such as:

These packages are available via nur.
