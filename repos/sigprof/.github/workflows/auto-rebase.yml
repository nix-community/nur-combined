  # to hide the `auto-rebase` workflow from the list of checks at the cost of
  # losing the possibility to autorebase PRs to branches that are not checked
  # by CI on every push (or, more precisely, such PRs will be rebased only when
  # something else triggers the `CI` workflow, not immediately after every push
  # to the base branch).

  # This also makes adding a schedule for this workflow mostly unnecessary,
  # because the `CI` workflow already has a schedule.
