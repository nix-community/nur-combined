This repo has 3 types of packages:

- `custom`: Packages that I maintain myself and are not in nixpkgs. (ex: `moonplayer`, `yaagl`)
- `modified`: Packages that are in nixpkgs but I modified to fit my needs. (ex: `beeper-nightly`, `osu-tachyon`)
- `support`: Packages that have been modified to support other architectures/operating systems (ex: `gimp`, `dolphin-emu`).
