# /sc:troubleshoot - Issue Diagnosis and Resolution

## Triggers
- Code defects and runtime error investigation requests
- Build failure analysis and resolution needs
- Performance issue diagnosis and optimization requirements
- Deployment problem analysis and system behavior debugging

## Usage
```
/sc:troubleshoot [issue] [--type bug|build|performance|deployment] [--trace] [--fix]
```

## Behavioral Flow
1. **Analyze**: Examine issue description and gather relevant system state information
2. **Investigate**: Identify potential root causes through systematic pattern analysis
3. **Debug**: Execute structured debugging procedures including log and state examination
4. **Propose**: Validate solution approaches with impact assessment and risk evaluation
5. **Resolve**: Apply appropriate fixes and verify resolution effectiveness

Key behaviors:
- Systematic root cause analysis with hypothesis testing and evidence collection
- Multi-domain troubleshooting (code, build, performance, deployment)
- Structured debugging methodologies with comprehensive problem analysis
- Safe fix application with verification and documentation

## Tool Coordination
- **Read**: Log analysis and system state examination
- **Bash**: Diagnostic command execution and system investigation
- **Grep**: Error pattern detection and log analysis
- **Write**: Diagnostic reports and resolution documentation

## Key Patterns
- **Bug Investigation**: Error analysis → stack trace examination → code inspection → fix validation
- **Build Troubleshooting**: Build log analysis → dependency checking → configuration validation
- **Performance Diagnosis**: Metrics analysis → bottleneck identification → optimization recommendations
- **Deployment Issues**: Environment analysis → configuration verification → service validation

## Examples

### Code Bug Investigation
```
/sc:troubleshoot "Null pointer exception in user service" --type bug --trace
# Systematic analysis of error context and stack traces
# Identifies root cause and provides targeted fix recommendations
```

### Build Failure Analysis
```
/sc:troubleshoot "TypeScript compilation errors" --type build --fix
# Analyzes build logs and TypeScript configuration
# Automatically applies safe fixes for common compilation issues
```

### Performance Issue Diagnosis
```
/sc:troubleshoot "API response times degraded" --type performance
# Performance metrics analysis and bottleneck identification
# Provides optimization recommendations and monitoring guidance
```

### Deployment Problem Resolution
```
/sc:troubleshoot "Service not starting in production" --type deployment --trace
# Environment and configuration analysis
# Systematic verification of deployment requirements and dependencies
```

## Boundaries

**Will:**
- Execute systematic issue diagnosis using structured debugging methodologies
- Provide validated solution approaches with comprehensive problem analysis
- Apply safe fixes with verification and detailed resolution documentation

**Will Not:**
- Apply risky fixes without proper analysis and user confirmation
- Modify production systems without explicit permission and safety validation
- Make architectural changes without understanding full system impact

## CRITICAL BOUNDARIES

**DIAGNOSE FIRST - FIXES REQUIRE `--fix` FLAG**

This command is DIAGNOSIS-FIRST by default.

**Default behavior (no `--fix` flag)**:
- Diagnose the issue
- Identify root cause
- Propose solution options
- **STOP and present findings to user** - do not apply any fixes

**With `--fix` flag**:
- After diagnosis, prompt user for confirmation before applying
- Apply fix only after user explicitly approves
- Verify fix with tests

**Explicitly Will NOT** (without `--fix` flag):
- Apply any code changes
- Modify any files
- Execute fixes automatically

**Output**: Diagnostic report containing:
- Issue description
- Root cause analysis
- Proposed solutions (ranked)
- Risk assessment for each solution

**Next Step**: User reviews diagnosis, then either:
- Re-run with `--fix` flag to apply recommended fix
- Use `/sc:improve` for broader refactoring
