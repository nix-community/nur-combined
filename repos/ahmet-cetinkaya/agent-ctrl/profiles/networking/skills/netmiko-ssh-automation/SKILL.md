# Netmiko SSH Automation

Use this skill when writing or reviewing Python automation that connects to
network devices with Netmiko. Keep the default path read-only; config changes
need a separate change window, peer review, and rollback plan.

## When to Use

- Collecting `show` command output across routers, switches, or firewalls.
- Building a small audit script for interface, routing, or config evidence.
- Adding timeouts and exception handling to network SSH scripts.
- Parsing command output with TextFSM when a template exists.
- Reviewing automation before it touches production devices.

## Safety Defaults

- Start with read-only `send_command()` collection.
- Keep inventory small and explicit; do not sweep whole address ranges.
- Use environment variables, a vault, or `getpass`; never hardcode credentials.
- Set connection and read timeouts.
- Limit concurrency so older devices are not overloaded.
- Require an explicit operator flag before `send_config_set()`.
- Do not call `save_config()` until the change has been verified and approved.

## Read-Only Connection Pattern

```python
import os
from getpass import getpass
from netmiko import ConnectHandler
from netmiko.exceptions import (
    NetmikoAuthenticationException,
    NetmikoTimeoutException,
    ReadTimeout,
)

device = {
    "device_type": "cisco_ios",
    "host": "192.0.2.10",
    "username": os.environ.get("NETMIKO_USERNAME") or input("Username: "),
    "password": os.environ.get("NETMIKO_PASSWORD") or getpass("Password: "),
    "secret": os.environ.get("NETMIKO_ENABLE_SECRET"),
    "conn_timeout": 10,
    "auth_timeout": 20,
    "banner_timeout": 15,
    "read_timeout_override": 30,
}

try:
    with ConnectHandler(**device) as conn:
        if device.get("secret") and not conn.check_enable_mode():
            conn.enable()
        output = conn.send_command("show ip interface brief", read_timeout=30)
        print(output)
except NetmikoAuthenticationException:
    print("Authentication failed")
except NetmikoTimeoutException:
    print("SSH connection timed out")
except ReadTimeout:
    print("Command read timed out")
```

Use placeholder addresses from documentation ranges in examples. Keep real
inventory in an ignored local file or a secrets-managed system.

## Batch Collection

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed
from typing import Any

def collect_show(device: dict[str, Any], command: str) -> dict[str, Any]:
    host = device["host"]
    try:
        with ConnectHandler(**device) as conn:
            output = conn.send_command(command, read_timeout=45)
        return {"host": host, "ok": True, "output": output}
    except (NetmikoAuthenticationException, NetmikoTimeoutException, ReadTimeout) as exc:
        return {"host": host, "ok": False, "error": type(exc).__name__}

results = []
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=8) as pool:
    futures = [pool.submit(collect_show, device, "show version") for device in devices]
    for future in as_completed(futures):
        results.append(future.result())
```

Keep `max_workers` low unless the device estate and AAA systems are known to
handle higher connection volume.

## Structured Parsing

Netmiko can ask TextFSM, TTP, or Genie to parse supported command output. Treat
parser output as an optimization, not the only evidence path.

```python
with ConnectHandler(**device) as conn:
    parsed = conn.send_command(
        "show ip interface brief",
        use_textfsm=True,
        raise_parsing_error=False,
        read_timeout=30,
    )

if isinstance(parsed, str):
    print("No parser template matched; store raw output for review")
else:
    for row in parsed:
        print(row)
```

If parsing drives a blocking decision, keep the raw command output alongside
the parsed result so an operator can inspect mismatches.

## Guarded Config Pattern

```python
import os

commands = [
    "interface GigabitEthernet0/1",
    "description CHANGE-1234 UPLINK-TO-CORE",
]

apply_changes = os.environ.get("APPLY_NETWORK_CHANGES") == "1"

if not apply_changes:
    print("Dry run only. Candidate commands:")
    print("\n".join(commands))
else:
    with ConnectHandler(**device) as conn:
        conn.enable()
        before = conn.send_command("show running-config interface GigabitEthernet0/1")
        output = conn.send_config_set(commands)
        after = conn.send_command("show running-config interface GigabitEthernet0/1")
        print(before)
        print(output)
        print(after)
        print("Verify behavior before saving startup config.")
```

Saving the config is a separate approval step. In production, include a rollback
snippet and capture before/after evidence in the change record.

## Review Checklist

- Does the script identify an explicit inventory source?
- Are credentials absent from source, logs, and exception messages?
- Are `conn_timeout`, `auth_timeout`, and command `read_timeout` set?
- Are failures reported per device without stopping the whole batch?
- Does the script avoid broad scans and unbounded concurrency?
- Are config changes behind a dry-run or explicit operator flag?
- Is `save_config()` separate from the initial push and tied to verification?

## Anti-Patterns

- Hardcoding passwords, enable secrets, or private keys in source.
- Sending config commands as the default code path.
- Running automation against a CIDR range instead of a reviewed inventory.
- Logging full running configs to shared systems without sanitization.
- Treating parser success as proof that the device state is correct.
