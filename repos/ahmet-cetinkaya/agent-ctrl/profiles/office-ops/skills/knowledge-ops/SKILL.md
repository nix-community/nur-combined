# Knowledge Operations

Manage a multi-layered knowledge system for ingesting, organizing, syncing, and retrieving knowledge across multiple stores.

Prefer the live workspace model:
- code work lives in the real cloned repos
- active execution context lives in GitHub, Linear, and repo-local working-context files
- broader human-facing notes can live in a non-repo context/archive folder
- durable cross-machine memory belongs in the knowledge base, not in a shadow repo workspace

## When to Activate

- User wants to save information to their knowledge base
- Ingesting documents, conversations, or data into structured storage
- Syncing knowledge across systems (local files, MCP memory, Supabase, Git repos)
- Deduplicating or organizing existing knowledge
- User says "save this to KB", "sync knowledge", "what do I know about X", "ingest this", "update the knowledge base"
- Any knowledge management task beyond simple memory recall

## Knowledge Architecture

### Layer 1: Active execution truth
- **Sources:** GitHub issues, PRs, discussions, release notes, Linear issues/projects/docs
- **Use for:** the current operational state of the work
- **Rule:** if something affects an active engineering plan, roadmap, rollout, or release, prefer putting it here first

### Layer 2: Claude Code Memory (Quick Access)
- **Path:** `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/`
- **Format:** Markdown files with frontmatter
- **Types:** user preferences, feedback, project context, reference
- **Use for:** quick-access context that persists across conversations
- **Automatically loaded at session start**

### Layer 3: MCP Memory Server (Structured Knowledge Graph)
- **Access:** MCP memory tools (create_entities, create_relations, add_observations, search_nodes)
- **Use for:** Semantic search across all stored memories, relationship mapping
- **Cross-session persistence with queryable graph structure**

### Layer 4: Knowledge base repo / durable document store
- **Use for:** curated durable notes, session exports, synthesized research, operator memory, long-form docs
- **Rule:** this is the preferred durable store for cross-machine context when the content is not repo-owned code

### Layer 5: External Data Store (Supabase, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- **Use for:** Structured data, large document storage, full-text search
- **Good for:** Documents too large for memory files, data needing SQL queries

### Layer 6: Local context/archive folder
- **Use for:** human-facing notes, archived gameplans, local media organization, temporary non-code docs
- **Rule:** writable for information storage, but not a shadow code workspace
- **Do not use for:** active code changes or repo truth that should live upstream

## Ingestion Workflow

When new knowledge needs to be captured:

### 1. Classify
What type of knowledge is it?
- Business decision -> memory file (project type) + MCP memory
- Active roadmap / release / implementation state -> GitHub + Linear first
- Personal preference -> memory file (user/feedback type)
- Reference info -> memory file (reference type) + MCP memory
- Large document -> external data store + summary in memory
- Conversation/session -> knowledge base repo + short summary in memory

### 2. Deduplicate
Check if this knowledge already exists:
- Search memory files for existing entries
- Query MCP memory with relevant terms
- Check whether the information already exists in GitHub or Linear before creating another local note
- Do not create duplicates. Update existing entries instead.

### 3. Store
Write to appropriate layer(s):
- Always update Claude Code memory for quick access
- Use MCP memory for semantic searchability and relationship mapping
- Update GitHub / Linear first when the information changes live project truth
- Commit to the knowledge base repo for durable long-form additions

### 4. Index
Update any relevant indexes or summary files.

## Sync Operations

### Conversation Sync
Periodically sync conversation history into the knowledge base:
- Sources: Claude session files, Codex sessions, other agent sessions
- Destination: knowledge base repo
- Generate a session index for quick browsing
- Commit and push

### Workspace State Sync
Mirror important workspace configuration and scripts to the knowledge base:
- Generate directory maps
- Redact sensitive config before committing
- Track changes over time
- Do not treat the knowledge base or archive folder as the live code workspace

### GitHub / Linear Sync
When the information affects active execution:
- update the relevant GitHub issue, PR, discussion, release notes, or roadmap thread
- attach supporting docs to Linear when the work needs durable planning context
- only mirror a local note afterwards if it still adds value

### Cross-Source Knowledge Sync
Pull knowledge from multiple sources into one place:
- Claude/ChatGPT/Grok conversation exports
- Browser bookmarks
- GitHub activity events
- Write status summary, commit and push

## Memory Patterns

```
# Short-term: current session context
Use TodoWrite for in-session task tracking

# Medium-term: project memory files
Write to ~/.claude/projects/*/memory/ for cross-session recall

# Long-term: GitHub / Linear / KB
Put active execution truth in GitHub + Linear
Put durable synthesized context in the knowledge base repo

# Semantic layer: MCP knowledge graph
Use mcp__memory__create_entities for permanent structured data
Use mcp__memory__create_relations for relationship mapping
Use mcp__memory__add_observations for new facts about known entities
Use mcp__memory__search_nodes to find existing knowledge
```

## Best Practices

- Keep memory files concise. Archive old data rather than letting files grow unbounded.
- Use frontmatter (YAML) for metadata on all knowledge files.
- Deduplicate before storing. Search first, then create or update.
- Prefer one canonical home per fact set. Avoid parallel copies of the same plan across local notes, repo files, and tracker docs.
- Redact sensitive information (API keys, passwords) before committing to Git.
- Use consistent naming conventions for knowledge files (lowercase-kebab-case).
- Tag entries with topics/categories for easier retrieval.

## Quality Gate

Before completing any knowledge operation:
- no duplicate entries created
- sensitive data redacted from any Git-tracked files
- indexes and summaries updated
- appropriate storage layer chosen for the data type
- cross-references added where relevant
