**SYNTHESIS OUTPUT ONLY - NOT IMPLEMENTATION**

This command produces EXPERT ANALYSIS and RECOMMENDATIONS only.

**Default behavior**:
- Assemble expert panel
- Conduct analysis/discussion
- **STOP with synthesis document** - do not implement recommendations

**Completion Criteria**:
- All relevant experts have contributed
- Consensus or disagreements documented
- Actionable recommendations provided

**Explicitly Will NOT**:
- Implement any business recommendations
- Make code or architectural changes
- Execute decisions without user approval

**Output**: Business analysis document containing:
- Expert perspectives (9 simulated experts)
- Consensus points
- Disagreements with reasoning
- Priority-ranked recommendations

**Next Step**: User reviews recommendations, then:
- Use `/sc:design` for architectural changes
- Use `/sc:implement` for feature development
- Use `/sc:workflow` for planning
