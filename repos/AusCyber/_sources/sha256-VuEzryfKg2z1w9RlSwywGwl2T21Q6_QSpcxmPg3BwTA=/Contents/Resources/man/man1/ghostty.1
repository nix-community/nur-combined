.SH NAME
\f[B]ghostty\f[R] \- Ghostty terminal emulator
.SH DESCRIPTION
Ghostty is a cross\-platform, GPU\-accelerated terminal emulator that
aims to push the boundaries of what is possible with a terminal emulator
by exposing modern, opt\-in features that enable CLI tool developers to
build more feature rich, interactive applications.
.PP
There are a number of excellent terminal emulator options that exist
today.
The unique goal of Ghostty is to have a platform for experimenting with
modern, optional, non\-standards\-compliant features to enhance the
capabilities of CLI applications.
We aim to be the best in this category, and competitive in the rest.
.PP
While aiming for this ambitious goal, Ghostty is a fully standards
compliant terminal emulator that aims to remain compatible with all
existing shells and software.
You can use this as a drop\-in replacement for your existing terminal
emulator.
.SH COMMAND LINE ACTIONS
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]\-\-version\f[B]\f[R]
The \f[CR]version\f[R] command is used to display information about
Ghostty.
Recognized as either \f[CR]+version\f[R] or \f[CR]\-\-version\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]\-\-help\f[B]\f[R]
The \f[CR]help\f[R] command shows general help about Ghostty.
Recognized as either
\f[CR]\-h,\f[R]\(enhelp\f[CR], or like other actions\f[R]+help\(ga.
.RS
.PP
You can also specify \f[CR]\-\-help\f[R] or \f[CR]\-h\f[R] along with
any action such as \f[CR]+list\-themes\f[R] to see help for a specific
action.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]+list\-fonts\f[B]\f[R]
The \f[CR]list\-fonts\f[R] command is used to list all the available
fonts for Ghostty.
This uses the exact same font discovery mechanism Ghostty uses to find
fonts to use.
.RS
.PP
When executed with no arguments, this will list all available fonts,
sorted by family name, then font name.
If a family name is given with \f[CR]\-\-family\f[R], the sorting will
be disabled and the results instead will be shown in the same priority
order Ghostty would use to pick a font.
.PP
Flags:
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]\-\-bold\f[R]: Filter results to specific bold styles.
It is not guaranteed that only those styles are returned.
They are only prioritized.
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]\-\-italic\f[R]: Filter results to specific italic styles.
It is not guaranteed that only those styles are returned.
They are only prioritized.
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]\-\-style\f[R]: Filter results based on the style string
advertised by a font.
It is not guaranteed that only those styles are returned.
They are only prioritized.
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]\-\-family\f[R]: Filter results to a specific font family.
The family handling is identical to the \f[CR]font\-family\f[R] set of
Ghostty configuration values, so this can be used to debug why your
desired font may not be loading.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]+list\-keybinds\f[B]\f[R]
The \f[CR]list\-keybinds\f[R] command is used to list all the available
keybinds for Ghostty.
.RS
.PP
When executed without any arguments this will list the current keybinds
loaded by the config file.
If no config file is found or there aren\(cqt any changes to the
keybinds it will print out the default ones configured for Ghostty
.PP
Flags:
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]\-\-default\f[R]: will print out all the default keybinds
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]\-\-docs\f[R]: currently does nothing, intended to print out
documentation about the action associated with the keybinds
.IP \(bu 2

friendly for Unix tooling.
This is default when not printing to a tty.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]+list\-themes\f[B]\f[R]
The \f[CR]list\-themes\f[R] command is used to preview or list all the
available themes for Ghostty.
.RS
.PP
If this command is run from a TTY, a TUI preview of the themes will be
shown.
While in the preview, \f[CR]F1\f[R] will bring up a help screen and
\f[CR]ESC\f[R] will exit the preview.
Other keys that can be used to navigate the preview are listed in the
help screen.
.PP
If this command is not run from a TTY, or the output is piped to another
command, a plain list of theme names will be printed to the screen.
A plain list can be forced using the \f[CR]\-\-plain\f[R] CLI flag.
.PP
Two different directories will be searched for themes.
.PP
The first directory is the \f[CR]themes\f[R] subdirectory of your
Ghostty configuration directory.
This is \f[CR]$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ghostty/themes\f[R] or
\f[CR]\(ti/.config/ghostty/themes\f[R].
.PP
The second directory is the \f[CR]themes\f[R] subdirectory of the
Ghostty resources directory.
Ghostty ships with a multitude of themes that will be installed into
this directory.
On macOS, this directory is the
\f[CR]Ghostty.app/Contents/Resources/ghostty/themes\f[R].
On Linux, this directory is the \f[CR]share/ghostty/themes\f[R]
(wherever you installed the Ghostty \(lqshare\(rq directory).
If you\(cqre running Ghostty from the source, this is the
\f[CR]zig\-out/share/ghostty/themes\f[R] directory.
.PP
You can also set the \f[CR]GHOSTTY_RESOURCES_DIR\f[R] environment
variable to point to the resources directory.
.PP
Flags:
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]\-\-path\f[R]: Show the full path to the theme.
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]\-\-plain\f[R]: Force a plain listing of themes.
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]\-\-color\f[R]: Specify the color scheme of the themes included in
the list.
This can be \f[CR]dark\f[R], \f[CR]light\f[R], or \f[CR]all\f[R].
The default is \f[CR]all\f[R].
.RE
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]+list\-colors\f[B]\f[R]
The \f[CR]list\-colors\f[R] command is used to list all the named RGB
colors in Ghostty.
.RS
.PP
Flags:
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]\-\-plain\f[R]: will disable formatting and make the output more

.RE
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]+list\-actions\f[B]\f[R]
The \f[CR]list\-actions\f[R] command is used to list all the available
keybind actions for Ghostty.
These are distinct from the CLI Actions which can be listed via
\f[CR]+help\f[R]
.RS
.PP

\f[B]\f[CB]+ssh\-cache\f[B]\f[R]
Manage the SSH terminfo cache for automatic remote host setup.
.RS
.PP
When SSH integration is enabled with
\f[CR]shell\-integration\-features = ssh\-terminfo\f[R], Ghostty
automatically installs its terminfo on remote hosts.
This command manages the cache of successful installations to avoid
redundant uploads.
.PP
The cache stores hostnames (or user\(athostname combinations) along with
timestamps.
Entries older than the expiration period are automatically removed
during cache operations.
By default, entries never expire.
.PP
Only one of \f[CR]\-\-clear\f[R], \f[CR]\-\-add\f[R],
\f[CR]\-\-remove\f[R], or \f[CR]\-\-host\f[R] can be specified.
If multiple are specified, one of the actions will be executed but it
isn\(cqt guaranteed which one.
This is entirely unsafe so you should split multiple actions into
separate commands.
.PP
Examples: ghostty +ssh\-cache # List all cached hosts ghostty
+ssh\-cache \(enhost=example.com # Check if host is cached ghostty
+ssh\-cache \(enadd=example.com # Manually add host to cache ghostty
+ssh\-cache \(enadd=user\(atexample.com # Add user\(athost combination
ghostty +ssh\-cache \(enremove=example.com # Remove host from cache
ghostty +ssh\-cache \(enclear # Clear entire cache ghostty +ssh\-cache
\(enexpire\-days=30 # Set custom expiration period

.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]+edit\-config\f[B]\f[R]
The \f[CR]edit\-config\f[R] command opens the Ghostty configuration file
in the editor specified by the \f[CR]$VISUAL\f[R] or \f[CR]$EDITOR\f[R]
environment variables.
.RS
.PP
IMPORTANT: This command will not reload the configuration after editing.
You will need to manually reload the configuration using the application
menu, configured keybind, or by restarting Ghostty.
We plan to auto\-reload in the future, but Ghostty isn\(cqt capable of
this yet.
.PP
The filepath opened is the default user\-specific configuration file,
which is typically located at
\f[CR]$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ghostty/config.ghostty\f[R].
On macOS, this may also be located at
\f[CR]\(ti/Library/Application Support/com.mitchellh.ghostty/config.ghostty\f[R].
On macOS, whichever path exists and is non\-empty will be prioritized,
prioritizing the Application Support directory if neither are
non\-empty.
.PP
This command prefers the \f[CR]$VISUAL\f[R] environment variable over
\f[CR]$EDITOR\f[R], if both are set.
If neither are set, it will print an error and exit.
.RE
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]+show\-config\f[B]\f[R]
The \f[CR]show\-config\f[R] command shows the current configuration in a
valid Ghostty configuration file format.
.RS
.PP
When executed without any arguments this will output the current
configuration that is different from the default configuration.
If you\(cqre using the default configuration this will output nothing.
.PP
If you are a new user and want to see all available options with
documentation, run
\f[CR]ghostty +show\-config \-\-default \-\-docs\f[R].
.PP
The output is not in any specific order, but the order should be
consistent between runs.
The output is not guaranteed to be exactly match the input configuration
files, but it will result in the same behavior.
Comments, whitespace, and other formatting is not preserved from user
configuration files.
.PP
Flags:
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]\-\-default\f[R]: Show the default configuration instead of
loading the user configuration.
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]\-\-changes\-only\f[R]: Only show the options that have been

\f[B]\f[CB]+show\-face\f[B]\f[R]
The \f[CR]show\-face\f[R] command shows what font face Ghostty will use
to render a specific codepoint.
Note that this command does not take into consideration grapheme
clustering or any other Unicode features that might modify the
presentation of a codepoint, so this may show a different font face than
Ghostty uses to render a codepoint in a terminal session.
.RS
.PP
Flags:
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]\-\-cp\f[R]: Find the face for a single codepoint.
The codepoint may be specified in decimal (\f[CR]\-\-cp=65\f[R]),
hexadecimal (\f[CR]\-\-cp=0x41\f[R]), octal (\f[CR]\-\-cp=0o101\f[R]),
or binary (\f[CR]\-\-cp=0b1000001\f[R]).
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]\-\-string\f[R]: Find the face for all of the codepoints in a

.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]+new\-window\f[B]\f[R]
The \f[CR]new\-window\f[R] will use native platform IPC to open up a new
window in a running instance of Ghostty.
.RS
.PP
If the \f[CR]\-\-class\f[R] flag is not set, the \f[CR]new\-window\f[R]
command will try and connect to a running instance of Ghostty based on
what optimizations the Ghostty CLI was compiled with.
Otherwise the \f[CR]new\-window\f[R] command will try and contact a
running Ghostty instance that was configured with the same
\f[CR]class\f[R] as was given on the command line.
.PP
If the \f[CR]\-e\f[R] flag is included on the command line, any
arguments that follow will be sent to the running Ghostty instance and
used as the command to run in the new window rather than the default.
If \f[CR]\-e\f[R] is not specified, Ghostty will use the default command
(either specified with \f[CR]command\f[R] in your config or your default
shell as configured on your system).
.PP
GTK uses an application ID to identify instances of applications.
If Ghostty is compiled with release optimizations, the default
application ID will be \f[CR]com.mitchellh.ghostty\f[R].
If Ghostty is compiled with debug optimizations, the default application
ID will be \f[CR]com.mitchellh.ghostty\-debug\f[R].
The \f[CR]class\f[R] configuration entry can be used to set up a custom
application ID.
The class name must follow the requirements defined \c
.UR https://docs.gtk.org/gio/type_func.Application.id_is_valid.html
in the GTK documentation
.UE \c

above.
.PP
On GTK, D\-Bus activation must be properly configured.
Ghostty does not need to be running for this to open a new window,
making it suitable for binding to keys in your window manager (if other
methods for configuring global shortcuts are unavailable).
D\-Bus will handle launching a new instance of Ghostty if it is not
already running.
See the Ghostty website for information on properly configuring D\-Bus
activation.

.SH CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
.TP
\f[B]\f[CB]\-\-font\-family\f[B]\f[R]
The font families to use.
.RS
.PP
You can generate the list of valid values using the CLI:
.IP
.EX
ghostty +list\-fonts
.EE
.PP
This configuration can be repeated multiple times to specify preferred
fallback fonts when the requested codepoint is not available in the
primary font.
This is particularly useful for multiple languages, symbolic fonts, etc.
.PP
Notes on emoji specifically: On macOS, Ghostty by default will always
use Apple Color Emoji and on Linux will always use Noto Emoji.
You can override this behavior by specifying a font family here that
contains emoji glyphs.
.PP
The specific styles (bold, italic, bold italic) do not need to be
explicitly set.
If a style is not set, then the regular style (font\-family) will be
searched for stylistic variants.
If a stylistic variant is not found, Ghostty will use the regular style.
This prevents falling back to a different font family just to get a
style such as bold.
This also applies if you explicitly specify a font family for a style.
For example, if you set \f[CR]font\-family\-bold = FooBar\f[R] and
\(lqFooBar\(rq cannot be found, Ghostty will use whatever font is set
for \f[CR]font\-family\f[R] for the bold style.
.PP
Finally, some styles may be synthesized if they are not supported.
For example, if a font does not have an italic style and no alternative
italic font is specified, Ghostty will synthesize an italic style by
applying a slant to the regular style.
If you want to disable these synthesized styles then you can use the
\f[CR]font\-style\f[R] configurations as documented below.
.PP
You can disable styles completely by using the \f[CR]font\-style\f[R]
set of configurations.
See the documentation for \f[CR]font\-style\f[R] for more information.
.PP
If you want to overwrite a previous set value rather than append a
fallback, specify the value as \f[CR]\(dq\(dq\f[R] (empty string) to
reset the list and then set the new values.
For example:
.IP
.EX
font\-family = \(dq\(dq
font\-family = \(dqMy Favorite Font\(dq
.EE
.PP
Setting any of these as CLI arguments will automatically clear the
values set in configuration files so you don\(cqt need to specify
\f[CR]\-\-font\-family=\(dq\(dq\f[R] before setting a new value.
You only need to specify this within config files if you want to clear
previously set values in configuration files or on the CLI if you want
to clear values set on the CLI.

For example, \(lqIosevka Heavy\(rq has a style of \(lqHeavy\(rq.
.RS

You can also use these fields to completely disable a font style.
If you set the value of the configuration below to literal
\f[CR]false\f[R] then that font style will be disabled.
If the running program in the terminal requests a disabled font style,
the regular font style will be used instead.

Control whether Ghostty should synthesize a style if the requested style
is not available in the specified font\-family.
.RS
.PP
Ghostty can synthesize bold, italic, and bold italic styles if the font
does not have a specific style.
For bold, this is done by drawing an outline around the glyph of varying
thickness.
For italic, this is done by applying a slant to the glyph.
For bold italic, both of these are applied.
.PP
Synthetic styles are not perfect and will generally not look as good as
a font that has the style natively.
However, they are useful to provide styled text when the font does not
have the style.
.PP
Set this to \(lqfalse\(rq or \(lqtrue\(rq to disable or enable synthetic
styles completely.
You can disable specific styles using \(lqno\-bold\(rq,
\(lqno\-italic\(rq, and \(lqno\-bold\-italic\(rq.
You can disable multiple styles by separating them with a comma.
For example, \(lqno\-bold,no\-italic\(rq.
.PP
Available style keys are: \f[CR]bold\f[R], \f[CR]italic\f[R],
\f[CR]bold\-italic\f[R].
.PP
If synthetic styles are disabled, then the regular style will be used
instead if the requested style is not available.
If the font has the requested style, then the font will be used as\-is
since the style is not synthetic.
.PP
Warning: An easy mistake is to disable \f[CR]bold\f[R] or
\f[CR]italic\f[R] but not \f[CR]bold\-italic\f[R].
Disabling only \f[CR]bold\f[R] or \f[CR]italic\f[R] will NOT disable
either in the \f[CR]bold\-italic\f[R] style.
If you want to disable \f[CR]bold\-italic\f[R], you must explicitly

\f[B]\f[CB]\-\-font\-variation\f[B]\f[R]
A repeatable configuration to set one or more font variations values for
a variable font.
A variable font is a single font, usually with a filename ending in
\f[CR]\-VF.ttf\f[R] or \f[CR]\-VF.otf\f[R] that contains one or more
configurable axes for things such as weight, slant, etc.
Not all fonts support variations; only fonts that explicitly state they
are variable fonts will work.
.RS
.PP
The format of this is \f[CR]id=value\f[R] where \f[CR]id\f[R] is the
axis identifier.
An axis identifier is always a 4 character string, such as
\f[CR]wght\f[R].
To get the list of supported axes, look at your font documentation or
use a font inspection tool.
.PP
Invalid ids and values are usually ignored.
For example, if a font only supports weights from 100 to 700, setting
\f[CR]wght=800\f[R] will do nothing (it will not be clamped to 700).
You must consult your font\(cqs documentation to see what values are
supported.

Codepoints ranges are specified as \f[CR]U+ABCD\-U+DEFG\f[R].
You can specify multiple ranges for the same font separated by commas,

A \(lqrun\(rq is a contiguous segment of text that is shaped together.
\(lqShaping\(rq is the process of converting text (codepoints) into
glyphs (renderable characters).
This is how ligatures are formed, among other things.
For example, if a coding font turns \(lq!=\(rq into a single glyph, then
it must see \(lq!\(rq and \(lq=\(rq next to each other in a single run.
When a run is broken, the text is shaped separately.
To continue our example, if \(lq!\(rq is at the end of one run and
\(lq=\(rq is at the start of the next run, then the ligature will not be
formed.
.PP
Ghostty breaks runs at certain points to improve readability or

\f[B]\f[CB]\-\-keybind\f[B]\f[R]
Key bindings.
The format is \f[CR]trigger=action\f[R].
Duplicate triggers will overwrite previously set values.
The list of actions is available in the documentation or using the
\f[CR]ghostty +list\-actions\f[R] command.
.RS
.PP
Trigger: \f[CR]+\f[R]\-separated list of keys and modifiers.
Example: \f[CR]ctrl+a\f[R], \f[CR]ctrl+shift+b\f[R], \f[CR]up\f[R].
.PP
If the key is a single Unicode codepoint, the trigger will match any
presses that produce that codepoint.
These are impacted by keyboard layouts.
For example, \f[CR]a\f[R] will match the \f[CR]a\f[R] key on a QWERTY
keyboard, but will match the \f[CR]q\f[R] key on a AZERTY keyboard
(assuming US physical layout).
.PP
For Unicode codepoints, matching is done by comparing the set of
modifiers with the unmodified codepoint.
The unmodified codepoint is sometimes called an \(lqunshifted
character\(rq in other software, but all modifiers are considered, not
only shift.
For example, \f[CR]ctrl+a\f[R] will match \f[CR]a\f[R] but not
\f[CR]ctrl+shift+a\f[R] (which is \f[CR]A\f[R] on a US keyboard).
.PP
Further, codepoint matching is case\-insensitive and the unmodified
codepoint is always case folded for comparison.
As a result, \f[CR]ctrl+A\f[R] configured will match when
\f[CR]ctrl+a\f[R] is pressed.
Note that this means some key combinations are impossible depending on
keyboard layout.
For example, \f[CR]ctrl+_\f[R] is impossible on a US keyboard because
\f[CR]_\f[R] is \f[CR]shift+\-\f[R] and \f[CR]ctrl+shift+\-\f[R] is not
equal to \f[CR]ctrl+_\f[R] (because the modifiers don\(cqt match!).
More details on impossible key combinations can be found at this
excellent source written by Qt developers:
https://doc.qt.io/qt\-6/qkeysequence.html#keyboard\-layout\-issues
.PP
Physical key codes can be specified by using any of the key codes as
specified by the \c
.UR https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-code/
W3C specification
.UE \c
\&.
For example, \f[CR]KeyA\f[R] will match the physical \f[CR]a\f[R] key on
a US standard keyboard regardless of the keyboard layout.
These are case\-sensitive.
.PP
For aesthetic reasons, the w3c codes also support snake case.
For example, \f[CR]key_a\f[R] is equivalent to \f[CR]KeyA\f[R].
The only exceptions are function keys, e.g.\ \f[CR]F1\f[R] is
\f[CR]f1\f[R] (no underscore).
This is a consequence of our internal code using snake case but is
purposely supported and tested so it is safe to use.
It allows an all\-lowercase binding which I find more aesthetically
pleasing.
.PP
Function keys such as \f[CR]insert\f[R], \f[CR]up\f[R], \f[CR]f5\f[R],
etc.
are also specified using the keys as specified by the previously linked
W3C specification.
.PP
Physical keys always match with a higher priority than Unicode
codepoints, so if you specify both \f[CR]a\f[R] and \f[CR]KeyA\f[R], the
physical key will always be used regardless of what order they are
configured.
.PP
Valid modifiers are \f[CR]shift\f[R], \f[CR]ctrl\f[R] (alias:
\f[CR]control\f[R]), \f[CR]alt\f[R] (alias: \f[CR]opt\f[R],
\f[CR]option\f[R]), and \f[CR]super\f[R] (alias: \f[CR]cmd\f[R],
\f[CR]command\f[R]).
You may use the modifier or the alias.
When debugging keybinds, the non\-aliased modifier will always be used
in output.
.PP
Note: The fn or \(lqglobe\(rq key on keyboards are not supported as a
modifier.
This is a limitation of the operating systems and GUI toolkits that
Ghostty uses.
.PP
Some additional notes for triggers:
.IP \(bu 2
modifiers cannot repeat, \f[CR]ctrl+ctrl+a\f[R] is invalid.
.IP \(bu 2
modifiers and keys can be in any order, \f[CR]shift+a+ctrl\f[R] is
\f[I]weird\f[R], but valid.
.IP \(bu 2
only a single key input is allowed, \f[CR]ctrl+a+b\f[R] is invalid.
.PP
You may also specify multiple triggers separated by \f[CR]>\f[R] to
require a sequence of triggers to activate the action.
For example, \f[CR]ctrl+a>n=new_window\f[R] will only trigger the
\f[CR]new_window\f[R] action if the user presses \f[CR]ctrl+a\f[R]
followed separately by \f[CR]n\f[R].
In other software, this is sometimes called a leader key, a key chord, a
key table, etc.
There is no hardcoded limit on the number of parts in a sequence.
.PP
Warning: If you define a sequence as a CLI argument to
\f[CR]ghostty\f[R], you probably have to quote the keybind since
\f[CR]>\f[R] is a special character in most shells.
Example: ghostty \(enkeybind=`ctrl+a>n=new_window'
.PP
A trigger sequence has some special handling:
.IP \(bu 2
Ghostty will wait an indefinite amount of time for the next key in the
sequence.
There is no way to specify a timeout.
The only way to force the output of a prefix key is to assign another
keybind to specifically output that key
(e.g.\ \f[CR]ctrl+a>ctrl+a=text:foo\f[R]) or press an unbound key which
will send both keys to the program.
.IP \(bu 2
If a prefix in a sequence is previously bound, the sequence will
override the previous binding.
For example, if \f[CR]ctrl+a\f[R] is bound to \f[CR]new_window\f[R] and
\f[CR]ctrl+a>n\f[R] is bound to \f[CR]new_tab\f[R], pressing
\f[CR]ctrl+a\f[R] will do nothing.
.IP \(bu 2
Adding to the above, if a previously bound sequence prefix is used in a
new, non\-sequence binding, the entire previously bound sequence will be
unbound.
For example, if you bind \f[CR]ctrl+a>n\f[R] and \f[CR]ctrl+a>t\f[R],
and then bind \f[CR]ctrl+a\f[R] directly, both \f[CR]ctrl+a>n\f[R] and
\f[CR]ctrl+a>t\f[R] will become unbound.
.IP \(bu 2
Trigger sequences are not allowed for \f[CR]global:\f[R] or
\f[CR]all:\f[R]\-prefixed triggers.

.PP
Action is the action to take when the trigger is satisfied.

\f[CR]unconsumed:\f[R]
.RS 2

Do not consume the input.
By default, a keybind will consume the input, meaning that the
associated encoding (if any) will not be sent to the running program in
the terminal.
If you wish to send the encoded value to the program, specify the
\f[CR]unconsumed:\f[R] prefix before the entire keybind.
For example: \f[CR]unconsumed:ctrl+a=reload_config\f[R].
\f[CR]global:\f[R] and \f[CR]all:\f[R]\-prefixed keybinds will always
consume the input regardless of this setting.
Since they are not associated with a specific terminal surface,
they\(cqre never encoded.
.PP
Available since: 1.0.0
.RE
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]performable:\f[R]
.RS 2
.PP
Only consume the input if the action is able to be performed.
For example, the \f[CR]copy_to_clipboard\f[R] action will only consume
the input if there is a selection to copy.
If there is no selection, Ghostty behaves as if the keybind was not set.
This has no effect with \f[CR]global:\f[R] or \f[CR]all:\f[R]\-prefixed
keybinds.
For key sequences, this will reset the sequence if the action is not
performable (acting identically to not having a keybind set at all).
.PP
Performable keybinds will not appear as menu shortcuts in the
application menu.
This is because the menu shortcuts force the action to be performed
regardless of the state of the terminal.
Performable keybinds will still work, they just won\(cqt appear as a
shortcut label in the menu.

.PP
Keybind triggers are not unique per prefix combination.
For example, \f[CR]ctrl+a\f[R] and \f[CR]global:ctrl+a\f[R] are not two
separate keybinds.
The keybind set later will overwrite the keybind set earlier.
In this case, the \f[CR]global:\f[R] keybind will be used.
.PP
Multiple prefixes can be specified.
For example, \f[CR]global:unconsumed:ctrl+a=reload_config\f[R] will make
the keybind global and not consume the input to reload the config.
.PP
Note: \f[CR]global:\f[R] is only supported on macOS and certain Linux
platforms.
.PP
On macOS, this feature requires accessibility permissions to be granted
to Ghostty.
When a \f[CR]global:\f[R] keybind is specified and Ghostty is launched
or reloaded, Ghostty will attempt to request these permissions.
If the permissions are not granted, the keybind will not work.
On macOS, you can find these permissions in System Preferences \->

We don\(cqt currently support specifying a size in pixels but a future
change can enable that.
If this isn\(cqt specified, the app runtime will determine some default
size.
.PP
Note that the window manager may put limits on the size or override the
size.
For example, a tiling window manager may force the window to be a
certain size to fit within the grid.
There is nothing Ghostty will do about this, but it will make an effort.
.PP
Sizes larger than the screen size will be clamped to the screen size.
This can be used to create a maximized\-by\-default window size.

This will not affect new tabs, splits, or other nested terminal

Changing this value will not affect the size of the window after it has
been created.

BUG: On Linux with GTK, the calculated window size will not properly

\f[B]\f[CB]\-\-window\-save\-state\f[B]\f[R]
Whether to enable saving and restoring window state.

There are three valid values for this configuration:
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]default\f[R] will use the default system behavior.
On macOS, this will only save state if the application is forcibly

.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]never\f[R] will never save window state.
.IP \(bu 2
\f[CR]always\f[R] will always save window state whenever Ghostty is
exited.
.PP
If you change this value to \f[CR]never\f[R] while Ghostty is not
running, the next Ghostty launch will NOT restore the window state.
.PP
If you change this value to \f[CR]default\f[R] while Ghostty is not
running and the previous exit saved state, the next Ghostty launch will
still restore the window state.
This is because Ghostty cannot know if the previous exit was due to a
forced save or not (macOS doesn\(cqt provide this information).
.PP
If you change this value so that window state is saved while Ghostty is
not running, the previous window state will not be restored because
Ghostty only saves state on exit if this is enabled.

SSH features work independently and can be combined for optimal

The style of the macOS titlebar.
Available values are: \(lqnative\(rq, \(lqtransparent\(rq, \(lqtabs\(rq,
and \(lqhidden\(rq.
.RS
.PP
The \(lqnative\(rq style uses the native macOS titlebar with zero
customization.
The titlebar will match your window theme (see
\f[CR]window\-theme\f[R]).
.PP
The \(lqtransparent\(rq style is the same as \(lqnative\(rq but the
titlebar will be transparent and allow your window background color to
come through.
This makes a more seamless window appearance but looks a little less
typical for a macOS application and may not work well with all themes.
.PP
The \(lqtransparent\(rq style will also update in real\-time to dynamic
changes to the window background color, e.g.\ via OSC 11.
To make this more aesthetically pleasing, this only happens if the
terminal is a window, tab, or split that borders the top of the window.
This avoids a disjointed appearance where the titlebar color changes but
all the topmost terminals don\(cqt match.
.PP
The \(lqtabs\(rq style is a completely custom titlebar that integrates
the tab bar into the titlebar.
This titlebar always matches the background color of the terminal.
There are some limitations to this style: On macOS 13 and below, saved
window state will not restore tabs correctly.
macOS 14 does not have this issue and any other macOS version has not
been tested.
.PP
The \(lqhidden\(rq style hides the titlebar.
Unlike \f[CR]window\-decoration = false\f[R], however, it does not
remove the frame from the window or cause it to have squared corners.
Changing to or from this option at run\-time may affect existing windows
in buggy ways.
.PP
When \(lqhidden\(rq, the top titlebar area can no longer be used for
dragging the window.
To drag the window, you can use option+click on the resizable areas of
the frame to drag the window.
This is a standard macOS behavior and not something Ghostty enables.
