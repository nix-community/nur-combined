The content of this repository is mirrored from https://github.com/aciceri/universe/tree/main/packages.
Unfortunately, this mirror is necessary because the `universe` repository uses Git LFS, which appears to break nur-combined. See [this issue](https://github.com/nix-community/nur-combined/issues/41) for more context.
