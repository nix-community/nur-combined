      Tagsistant is a semantic file system for Linux, a personal tool
      to catalog files using tags (labels, mnemonic informations)
      rather than directories.

      Tagsistant replace the concept of directory with that of tag, but
      since it have to do with directories, it pairs the concept of tag
      with that of directory. So within Tagsistant a tag is a directory
      and a directory is a tag.
