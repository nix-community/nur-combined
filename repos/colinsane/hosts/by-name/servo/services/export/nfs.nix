    # XXX: NFS over UDP REQUIRES SPECIAL CONFIG TO AVOID DATA LOSS.
    # see `man 5 nfs`: "Using NFS over UDP on high-speed links".
    # it's actually just a general property of UDP over IPv4 (IPv6 fixes it).
    # both the client and the server should configure a shorter-than-default IPv4 fragment reassembly window to mitigate.
    # OTOH, tunneling NFS over Wireguard also bypasses this weakness, because a mis-assembled packet would not have a valid signature.

    [exports]
    # all export paths are relative to rootdir.
    # for NFSv4, the export with fsid=0 behaves as `/` publicly,
    # but NFSv3 implements no such feature.
    # using `rootdir` instead of relying on `fsid=0` allows consistent export paths regardless of NFS proto version
    rootdir=/var/export
  '';

  # format:
  #   fspoint	visibility(options)
  # options:
  # - see: <https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Nfs-utils#Exports>
  # - see [man 5 exports](https://linux.die.net/man/5/exports)
  # - insecure:  require clients use src port > 1024
  # - rw, ro (default)
  # - async, sync (default)
  # - no_subtree_check (default), subtree_check: verify not just that files requested by the client live
  #     in the expected fs, but also that they live under whatever subdirectory of that fs is exported.
  # - no_root_squash, root_squash (default): map requests from uid 0 to user `nobody`.
  # - crossmnt:  reveal filesystems that are mounted under this endpoint
  # - fsid:  must be zero for the root export
  #   - fsid=root  is alias for fsid=0
  # - mountpoint[=/path]:  only export the directory if it's a mountpoint. used to avoid exporting failed mounts.
  # - all_squash: rewrite all client requests such that they come from anonuid/anongid
  #   - any files a user creates are owned by local anonuid/anongid.
  #   - users can read any local file which anonuid/anongid would be able to read.
  #   - users can't chown to/away from anonuid/anongid.
  #   - users can chmod files they own, to anything (making them unreadable to non-`nfsuser` export users, like FTP).
  #   - `stat` remains unchanged, returning the real UIDs/GIDs to the client.
  #     - thus programs which check `uid` or `gid` before trying an operation may incorrectly conclude they can't perform some op.
