  # - options:
  #   - "powersave" => force CPU to always run at lowest supported frequency
  #   - "performance" => force CPU to always run at highest frequency
  #   - "ondemand" => adjust frequency based on load
  #   - "conservative"  (ondemand but slower to adjust)
  #   - "schedutil"
  #   - "userspace"
  # - not all options are available for all platforms
  #   - intel (intel_pstate) appears to manage scaling w/o intervention/control from the OS.
  #   - AMD (acpi-cpufreq) appears to manage scaling via the OS *or* HW. but the ondemand defaults never put it to max hardware frequency.
  #   - qualcomm (cpufreq-dt) appears to manage scaling *only* via the OS. ondemand governor exercises the full range.
  # - query details with `sudo cpupower frequency-info`
