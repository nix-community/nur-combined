# Fractal: GTK4 instant messenger client for the Matrix protocol
#
# very susceptible to state corruption during hard power-cycles.
# if it stalls while launching, especially with a brief message at bottom
# "unable to open store"
# then:
# - remove ~/.local/share/fractal/*
#   - this might give I/O error, in which case remove the corresponding path under
#     /nix/persist/private/home/colin/ (which can be found by correlating timestamps/sizes with that in ~/private/.local/share/stable).
# - reboot (maybe necessary).
# - now you can send messages, and read messages in unencrypted rooms, but not read messages from encrypted rooms.
# to fix encrypted message receipt:
# - start from above (fractal closed, no ~/.local/share/fractal/*)
# - in ~/.local/share/keyrings/Default_keyring.keyring:
#   - find the entry that says "display-name=Fractal: Matrix credentials for <mxid>"
#   - remove that entry and all associated entries (i.e. ones with same number but different :attributeN)
#   - REBOOT. otherwise keyring stuff seems to stay cached in RAM
#   - login to Fractal. give an hour to sync.
#   - it'll kick you back to a page asking you to cross-sign. open another client (Fractal on other device; FluffyChat) and do the emoji compare. success!
