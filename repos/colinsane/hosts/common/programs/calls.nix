# GNOME calls
# - <https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/calls>
# - both a dialer and a call handler.
# - uses callaudiod dbus service.
#
# initial JMP.chat configuration:
# - message @cheogram.com "reset sip account"  (this is not destructive, despite the name)
# - the bot will reply with auto-generated username/password plus a SIP server endpoint.
#   just copy those into gnome-calls' GUI configurator
# - now gnome-calls can do outbound calls. inbound calls can be routed by messaging the bot: "configure calls"
#
# user guide:
# - "Use for Calls" means, "when i click a tel: URI, use this account": <https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/calls/-/issues/513>
# - `calls -vvv` for verbosity
# - `SOFIA_DEBUG=9 NEA_DEBUG=9 NUA_DEBUG=9 NTA_DEBUG=9 SU_DEBUG=8 gnome-calls` to debug SIP related stuff
#
# LIMITATIONS, COMPATIBILITY
# - 2024-08-20: when switching from wifi -> wwan (4g), may experience about a minute of audio loss.
#   the call stays alive, but no sound in either direction.
#   this appears to be ~40s of general net loss to servo-hn (NetworkManager being slow to switch the default device? wireguard being slow to refresh?),
#   unknown how much time is lost in the upper layers (e.g. dns being refreshed)
# - 2024-08-20: wwan -> wifi switching is (near) flawless. prefer to keep modem powered until end of call, because of audio routing, but OK to power it off.
# - 2024-08-20: audio is not always routed to a good device when the modem is powered.
#   solve by opening `pavucontrol`, go to "configuration" tab, change "Built-in audio" to anything and then back to "Make a phone call (Earpiece, Mic)".
#   i expect my eg25-control-powered script messes with the audio routing.
# - 2024-12-12: contacts are visible when evolution-data-server is enabled, however attempting to call triggers "Can't submit call with no origin"
