    # 2023/09/08: fix so clicking a notification can activate the corresponding window.

    #   - if sway activates the dino window (i.e. colors the workspace and tab), then all good
    #   - do all of this with only a touchscreen (e.g. on mobile phone) -- NOT a mouse/pointer
    # 2024/08/12: this patch is still necessary (for moby)
    ## what this patch does:
    # - allows any wayland window to request activation, at any time.
    # - traditionally, wayland only allows windows to request activation if
    #   the client requesting to transfer control has some connection to a recent user interaction.
    #   - e.g. the active window may transfer control to any window
    #   - a window which was very recently active may transfer control to itself
    ## alternative (longer-term) solutions:
    # - fix this class of bug in gtk:
    #   - <https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/merge_requests/5782>
    #   - N.B.: this linked PR doesn't actually fix it
    # - add xdg_activation_v1 support to SwayNC (my notification daemon):
    #   - <https://github.com/ErikReider/SwayNotificationCenter/issues/71>
    #   - mako notification daemon supports activation, can use as a reference
    #     - all of ~30 LoC, looks straight-forward
    #     - however, it's not clear that gtk4 (or dino) actually support this mode of activation.
