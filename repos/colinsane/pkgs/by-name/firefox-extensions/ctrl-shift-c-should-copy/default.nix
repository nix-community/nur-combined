      it comes with several limitations:
      - doesn't work on new-tab page
      - doesn't work if the focus isn't on page content
        - e.g. ctrl+shift+c from URL bar still brings up dev console, incorrectly.

      the proper fix to disabling Ctrl+Shift+C seems to require compiling Firefox from source, as of their Quantum project post-2019.
