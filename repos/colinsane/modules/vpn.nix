# to route all internet traffic through a VPN endpoint, run `systemctl start vpn-${vpnName}`
# to show the routing table: `ip rule`
# to show the NAT rules used for bridging: `sudo iptables -t nat --list-rules -v`
#
# the rough idea here is:
# 1. each VPN has an IP address: if we originate a packet, and the source address is the VPN's address, then it gets routed over the VPN trivially.
# 2a. create a bridge device for each VPN. traffic exiting that bridge is source-NAT'd to the VPN's address.
# 2b. to route all traffic for a specific application (or container), give it access to only the bridge device.
# 3a. create a separate routing table for each VPN, with table id = ID.
# 3b. if a packet enters the VPN's table then it will be routed via the VPN.
# 3c. to apply a VPN to all internet traffic, system-wide, a rule is added that forces each packet to enter that VPN's routing table.
#     - that's done with `systemctl start vpn-$VPN`.
#     - the VPN acts as the default route. so traffic destined to e.g. a LAN device do not traverse the VPN in this case. only internet traffic is VPN'd.
