  "description": "Away Days Podcast is an episodic documentary series focused on unreported stories from the fringes of society. \u00a0We're compassionately documenting the underground without watering it down or editorially obscuring it. This is independent journalism with no filter. Real, raw, and ugly. Journalist Jake Hanrahan, the host and creator of Away Days has spent the last 10 years embedded in places he's not meant to be. With unique access and a straightforward style of on-the-ground reporting, the listener will be taken deep into the places they didn't know existed.Watch Away Days documentaries at youtube.com/@awaydaystv",
