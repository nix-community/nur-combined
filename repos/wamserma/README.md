**My personal [NUR](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR) repository**

Want you own? I used [this template](https://github.com/nix-community/nur-packages-template).

## What's here?

I package up stuff here that is not interesting enough to clutter [nixpkgs](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs) with it. If you find somethig here that you want in [nixpkgs](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs), creat an issue and have people upvote.
Stuff here is mainly aiming for compatibility with the current stable release of NixOS, but many of this is also tested/used with Nix on Ubuntu or Debian.
