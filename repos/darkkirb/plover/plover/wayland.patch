+  <description summary="Protocol for creating input methods">
+    This protocol allows applications to act as input methods for compositors.
+
+    An input method context is used to manage the state of the input method.
+
+    Text strings are UTF-8 encoded, their indices and lengths are in bytes.
+
+    This document adheres to the RFC 2119 when using words like "must",
+    "should", "may", etc.
+
+    Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
+    backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
+    may be added together with the corresponding interface version bump.
+    Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
+    the protocol and interface names and resetting the interface version.
+    Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
+    version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
+    interface version number is reset.

+
+      The zwp_input_method_v2 object can occupy two distinct states: active and
